## Overview

The language-agnostic BERT sentence embedding encodes text into high dimensional
vectors. The model is trained and optimized to produce similar representations
exclusively for bilingual sentence pairs that are translations of each other. So
it can be used for mining for translations of a sentence in a larger corpus.

### Metrics

*   We apply this model to the united nation parallel corpus retrieval task,
    where for each English sentence we try to find its true translation from a
    9.5 million sentence pool from the other language

    UN          | en-es | en-fr | en-ru | en-zh
    :---------- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----:
    Precision@1 | 0.911 | 0.883 | 0.908 | 0.877

*   For tatoeba we evaluate on several language group.

    Tatoeba         | 36 languages from XTREME | All (112) languages
    :-------------- | -----------------------: | ------------------:
    Average Accuray | 0.950                    | 0.837

More details of the eval can be found in the paper [1].

To learn more about text embeddings, refer to the
[TensorFlow Embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings)
documentation. Our encoder differs from word level embedding models in that we
train on a number of natural language prediction tasks that require modeling the
meaning of word sequences rather than just individual words. Details are
available in the paper "Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding" [1].

## Extented Uses and Limitations

The produced embeddings can also be used for text classification, semantic
similarity, clustering and other natural language tasks. The performance may
depends on the domain / data match of a particular task. For general purpose
sentence embeddings, we refer to
[Universal Sentence Encoder family](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/universal-sentence-encoder/1).

It is adopted from a pre-trained BERT model so it can also be used for any tasks
BERT can be applied. The performance, again, depends on the particular task.
Users may consider the
[BERT model family](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bert/1).

## Example Use

Our model is based on the BERT transformer architecture, which generates a
pooled_output of shape [batch_size, 768] with representations for the entire
input sequences. The model takes the processed text using this
[preprocessor](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-cmlm/multilingual-preprocess/2).
The representation generated from this model is recommended to be used as is
without fine-tuning. The model is also fine-tunable like other BERT models. It
can be called like a regular BERT model as follows:

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_text as text  # Needed for loading universal-sentence-encoder-cmlm/multilingual-preprocess
import numpy as np

def normalization(embeds):
  norms = np.linalg.norm(embeds, 2, axis=1, keepdims=True)
  return embeds/norms

english_sentences = tf.constant(["dog", "Puppies are nice.", "I enjoy taking long walks along the beach with my dog."])
italian_sentences = tf.constant(["cane", "I cuccioli sono carini.", "Mi piace fare lunghe passeggiate lungo la spiaggia con il mio cane."])
japanese_sentences = tf.constant(["犬", "子犬はいいです", "私は犬と一緒にビーチを散歩するのが好きです"])

preprocessor = hub.KerasLayer(
    "https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-cmlm/multilingual-preprocess/2")
encoder = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE/2")

english_embeds = encoder(preprocessor(english_sentences))["default"]
japanese_embeds = encoder(preprocessor(japanese_sentences))["default"]
italian_embeds = encoder(preprocessor(italian_sentences))["default"]

# For semantic similarity tasks, apply l2 normalization to embeddings
english_embeds = normalization(english_embeds)
japanese_embeds = normalization(japanese_embeds)
italian_embeds = normalization(italian_embeds)

print (np.matmul(english_embeds, np.transpose(italian_embeds)))

# English-Japanese similarity
print (np.matmul(english_embeds, np.transpose(japanese_embeds)))

# Italian-Japanese similarity
print (np.matmul(italian_embeds, np.transpose(japanese_embeds)))
```

## Change log

2021.02.16 Update the module to use dict based input, which allows the model to
call text preprocessor module.
