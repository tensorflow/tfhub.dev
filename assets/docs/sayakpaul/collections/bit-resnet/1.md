# Collection sayakpaul/bit-resnet/1

Collection of new BiT-ResNet models trained on ImageNet-1k.

<!-- dataset: imagenet-ilsvrc-2012-cls -->
<!-- task: image-classification -->

## Overview

This collection contains BiT-ResNet [1] classifiers and feature extractors trained on ImageNet-1k [2]. They can be used for out-of-the-box inference as well as fine-tuning. These models are known to show excellent performance on several downstream tasks in computer vision as shown in [1]. Notably, the `152x2` (ResNet152x2) models were trained as a part of [3]. They act as teachers for
distilling the student `50x1` (ResNet50x1) models. At the time of this publication, these ResNet50 models set the state-of-the-art for ImageNet-1k classification at 224x224 and 160x160 input resolutions.

You can find the other BiT-ResNet models [here](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bit).

## Notes and acknowledgements

* The model weights are taken from the official code repository of BiT [4]. The initial weights are in NumPy and they were
ported to TensorFlow SavedModel format. 
* The porting steps are available in [5].
* Thanks to [Willi Gierke](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/willi-gierke) for helping with porting the weights. 


## Table of contents

Models included in this collection have two variants: (1) off-the-shelf inference, (2) fine-tuning on downstream tasks.
