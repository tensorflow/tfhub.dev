### Origin
This model is based on [rishit-dagli/mirnet-tfjs/1](https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/mirnet-tfjs/1/).

This model has been automatically converted using the [TF.js converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter).

### Overview
The MIRNet model proposed in Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement (Zamir et al.) [1] . The model can take a low-light image and enhance it to a great extent. The model has goals of maintaining high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving strong contextual information from the low-resolution representations. Here is an example result -

### Example use
Example use
This model can be loaded using TF.js as:

```js
tf.loadGraphModel("https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/mirnet-tfjs/default/uint16/1", { fromTFHub: true })
```
