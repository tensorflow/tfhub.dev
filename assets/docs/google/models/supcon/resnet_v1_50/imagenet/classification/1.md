The code used to train this model is available
[here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/supcon).

### Example use

This module implements the common signature for
[image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#classification).
It can be used with the hub.Module API like

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/supcon/resnet_v1_50/imagenet/classification/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
logits = module(images)  # Logits with shape [batch_size, 1000].
...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

module = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/supcon/resnet_v1_50/imagenet/classification/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
logits = module(images)  # Logits with shape [batch_size, 1000].
...
```

It's also possible to produce image embeddings using this model like:

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/supcon/resnet_v1_50/imagenet/classification/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
logits = module(images, as_dict=True)['unnormalized_embeddings']  # Embeddings with shape [batch_size, 2048].
...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

module = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/supcon/resnet_v1_50/imagenet/classification/1", output_key='unnormalized_embeddings')
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [224, 224, width, 3].
logits = module(images) # Embeddings with shape [batch_size, 2048].
...
```

### Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning of this model is only possible in TF1. To construct the module such
that it is trainable and the batch norms are in train mode:

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/supcon/resnet_v1_50/imagenet/classification/1" trainable=True, tags={'train'})
...
```

This will add the batch norm update ops to
`tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS)`. It will also make the sum of the
weight norms available in
`tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES)`. Note that the weight
norms are not scaled by any weight decay coefficient. The weight norms are also
split into 3 separate sums:

1.  The encoder weights: the base ResNet up through the final pooling layer.
1.  The projection head weights: The additional MLP that projects the embeddings
    to the representation that is used in the Supervised Contrastive loss.
1.  The classification head weights: The fully connected layer mapping the
    embeddings to the logits.
