## Overview

This model is a BiT-ResNet50x1 [1] distilled from a BiT-ResNet152x2 (originally trained on ImageNet-1k [2]). The distillation recipes can be referred from [3].

## Using this model

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/distill_bit_r50x1_224_feature_extraction/1", trainable=True)
])
predictions = model.predict(images) 
```

Inputs to the model must:

1. be four dimensional Tensors of the shape `(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`. Note that the model expects images with  `channels_last`  property. `num_channels` must be 3. 
2. be resized to 224x224 resolution.
3. have pixel values in the range `[-1, 1]`.


## Notes and acknowledgements

* The original model weights are provided as a `.npz` file [4]. There were ported to a TensorFlow SavedModel. The porting steps are available in [5].
* Thanks to [Willi Gierke](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/willi-gierke) for helping with porting the weights.
