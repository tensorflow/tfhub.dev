## Overview

This model is trained to classify an input image into one of 5 cassava diseases:
Bacterial Blight, Brown Streak Disease, Green Mite, Mosaic Disease, Healthy, and
Unknown.

The training dataset is curated by the
[Mak-AI](http://www.air.ug/) team at the
[Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/).

### Input

This model takes images as input.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 224 x 224,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_classifier`.

*   `image_classifier`: A probability vector of dimension 6, corresponding to a
    `background` class and the probability of 5 cassava diseases in the
    [labelmap](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/labelmaps/cassava_V1_label_map.csv).

## Example use

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.Module('https://tfhub.dev/google/cropnet/classifier/cassava_disease_V1/1')
...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/cropnet/classifier/cassava_disease_V1/1')
...
```

## Model architecture

For details of the model architecture, see
[MobileNet V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244).

## Suitable usecases

-   This model is trained to recognize five Cassava diseases.

## Unsuitable usecases

-   This model does not detect diseases in other plants.

## Known limitations

-   This model assumes that the input contains a well-cropped image of a Cassava
    plant. If the image contains some other plant, the output results may be
    meaningless.
-   In some cases, the model may misdiagnose or falsely diagnose a cassava
    disease. A misdiagnosed result might lead to the wrong treatment course
    being applied to cassava plants in the field.
-   This model should generally work on cassava plants from around the world,
    but was trained only on photos of diseased cassava plants taken in Uganda.
