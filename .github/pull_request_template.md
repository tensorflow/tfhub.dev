We check modified Markdown files for validity using [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfhub.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/contributions-validator.yml) GitHub Workflow. You can execute the same checks locally by passing the file paths of modified Markdown files (relative to the `assets/docs` directory) to validator.py e.g. `python3 ./tools/validator.py google/google.md google/models/albert_base/1.md ...`.
