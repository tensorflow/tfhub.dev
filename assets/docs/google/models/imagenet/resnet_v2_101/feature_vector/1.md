## Overview

ResNet V2 is a family of network architectures for image classification
with a variable number of layers. It builds on the ResNet architecture
originally published by

  * Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun: ["Deep Residual Learning
    for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), 2015.

The full preactivation 'V2' variant of ResNet used in this module was
introduced by

  * Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun: ["Identity Mappings in
    Deep Residual Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027), 2016.

The key difference compared to ResNet V1 is the use of batch normalization
before every weight layer.

This TF-Hub module uses the TF-Slim implementation of `resnet_v2_101`
with 101 layers.
The module contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use module
[`google/imagenet/resnet_v2_101/classification/1`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v2_101/classification/1)
instead.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this module was `resnet_v2_101_2017_04_14/resnet_v2_101.ckpt` downloaded
from
[TF-Slim's pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/README.md#pre-trained-models).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").


## Usage

This module implements the common signature for computing
[image feature vectors](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
It can be used like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v2_101/feature_vector/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

...or using the signature name `image_feature_vector`. The output for each image
in the batch is a feature vector of size `num_features` = 2048.

For this module, the size of the input image is fixed to
`height` x `width` = 224 x 224 pixels.
The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.


## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this module can [fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#fine-tuning) it.
This requires importing the graph version with tag set `{"train"}`
in order to operate batch normalization in training mode.
