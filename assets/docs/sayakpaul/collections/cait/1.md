# Collection sayakpaul/cait/1

Collection of CaiT models.

<!-- dataset: imagenet-ilsvrc-2012-cls -->
<!-- task: image-classification -->

## Overview

This collection contains different CaiT [1] models. For more details on the training protocols,
please follow [2]. The original model weights are provided from [2]. There were ported to Keras models
(`tf.keras.Model`) and then serialized as TensorFlow SavedModels. The porting steps are available in [3].
These models were pre-trained on the ImageNet-patch16 dataset.

## About the models

Models included in this collection have two variants: (1) off-the-shelf inference for image
classification, (2) fine-tuning on downstream tasks. These models are accompanied by
Colab Notebooks for demonstration purposes. 

The table below provides a performance summary:

| model_name     |   top1_acc(%) |   top5_acc(%) |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| cait_s24_224   |        83.368 |        96.576 |
| cait_xxs24_224 |        78.524 |        94.212 |
| cait_xxs36_224 |        79.76  |        94.876 |
| cait_xxs36_384 |        81.976 |        96.064 |
| cait_xxs24_384 |        80.648 |        95.516 |
| cait_xs24_384  |        83.738 |        96.756 |
| cait_s24_384   |        84.944 |        97.212 |
| cait_s36_384   |        85.192 |        97.372 |
| cait_m36_384   |        85.924 |        97.598 |


Note that the top-1 and top-5 accuracies are reported on the ImageNet-1k validation set. 
[This directory](https://github.com/sayakpaul/cait-tf/tree/main/i1k_eval) provides details
on how these numbers were generated. The results are in line with [1]. [Slight differences](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit/blob/main/README_cait.md#model-zoo) in the results stemmed from the different set of augmentation
transformations used during evaluation. Original transformations suggested by the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit/blob/main/README_cait.md).

## Notes

All the models output attention weights from each of the transformer blocks. The [classification Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/cait-tf/blob/main/notebooks/classification.ipynb) shows how to fetch the attention weights and generate attention maps for a given prediction image.
