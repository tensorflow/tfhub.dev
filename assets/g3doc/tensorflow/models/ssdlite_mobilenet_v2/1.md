# Placeholder tensorflow/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2/1
Object detection model trained on the COCO dataset.

<!-- module-type: image-object-detection -->

## Overview

An object detection model that has been released in the
[Tensorflow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md)
and trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org).

This model is available at http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_09.tar.gz.

The model is useful for out-of-the-box inference, but also useful for
initializing the models when training on novel datasets.
