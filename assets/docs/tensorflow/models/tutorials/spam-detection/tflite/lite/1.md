This code assumes the TensorFLow Lite Task Libraries for NLP have been added to your Android app. These task libraries encapsulate vocabulary management, and provide a high-level API to access the model:

```java
    public List<Category> classify(String text) {
        List<Category> apiResults = classifier.classify(text);
        return apiResults;
    }
```
