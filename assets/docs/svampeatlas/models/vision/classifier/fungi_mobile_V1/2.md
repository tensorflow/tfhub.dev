## Overview

### Module description

A mobile-compatible image classification model to recognize Scandinavian fungi
species. Trained on a dataset provided by Danish Mycological Society.

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 299 x 299,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_classifier`.

*   **`image_classifier`**: A probabability vector of dimension 4128, each of
    which corresponds to a Scandinavian mushroom species.

## Usage

### Use SavedModel in Python

The model can be loaded in a Python script as follows:

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/svampeatlas/vision/classifier/fungi_mobile_V1/2")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_outputs].
```

The input images are expected to have color values in the range [0,1], following
the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions. The input image size is 299x299 pixels.

Fine-tuning is not currently supported.

## Performance

### Online evaluation

Online evaluation was performed during training on the validation split (same
size as the training split).

At Step 233000, model performance is as follows:

*   **Recall@1**: 0.377
*   **Recall@5**: 0.591

### Training dataset

The weights for this module were obtained by training on the
[Scandinavian Fungi dataset](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/84d26682-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a),
provided by the [Danish Mycological Society](http://www.svampe.dk/). This
dataset is available for use under the
*[CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)* license.

This dataset was curated by the Danish Mycological Society. Images in the
dataset were obtained and released by the Danish Mycological Society.

### Model architecture

This model is based on the Mobilenet V2 architecture. Mobilenet V2 is a neural
network architecture for image classification, originally published by

*   Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard, Menglong Zhu, Andrey Zhmoginov, Liang-Chieh
    Chen:
    [“MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381), 2018.

### Additional information

Supports interactive model visualization.

## Suitable Use, Limitations, and Fair Use Terms

### Suitable use cases

This model is **suitable** for:

*   Retrieval of mushroom images from the Scandinavian region.

### Unsuitable use cases

This model is **unsuitable** for:

*   Distinguishing edible and inedible mushrooms.
*   Use in foraging applications.

### Limitations

*   This model may not generalize to cultivated or harvested mushrooms.
*   This model may not generalize to mushroom species common to other regions.
*   This model may not generalize to fungi species in non-user-captured images,
    such as museum specimens.
*   This model may not generalize to natural world species outside of the fungi
    kingdom.

## Changelog

#### Version 2

*   Fixes incorrect output tensor from the first version. The module now outputs
    softmax probability.

#### Version 1

*   Initial release of baseline model.
