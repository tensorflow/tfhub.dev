## hub.Module for TF1

This is a hub.Module for use with TensorFlow 1.

## Overview

Inception V3 is a neural network architecture for image classification,
originally published by

  * Christian Szegedy, Vincent Vanhoucke, Sergey Ioffe, Jonathon Shlens,
    Zbigniew Wojna: ["Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer
    Vision"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567), 2015.

This TF-Hub module uses the TF-Slim implementation of `inception_v3`.
The module contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to do the
[image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#classification)
that the network was trained on. If you merely want to transform images into
feature vectors, use module
[`google/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/3`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/3)
instead, and save the space occupied by the classification layer.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this module was `inception_v3_2016_08_28/inception_v3.ckpt` downloaded
from
[TF-Slim's pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/README.md#pre-trained-models).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").


## Usage

This module implements the common signature for
[image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#classification).
It can be used with the `hub.Module` API like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/3")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
logits = module(images)  # Logits with shape [batch_size, num_classes].
```

...or using the signature name `image_classification`.
For use with TF2 APIs, see TF Hub's [migration
guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/migration_tf2.md).

The indices into logits
are the `num_classes` = 1001 classes of the classification from
the original training (see above). The mapping from indices to class labels
can be found in the file at [download.tensorflow.org/data/ImageNetLabels.txt](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/ImageNetLabels.txt).

This module can also be used to compute [image feature
vectors](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector),
using the signature name `image_feature_vector`.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.
The expected size of the input images is
`height` x `width` = 299 x 299 pixels
by default, but other input sizes are possible (within limits).


## Fine-tuning

In principle, consumers of this module can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#fine-tuning) it.
However, fine-tuning through a large classification might be prone to overfit.

Fine-tuning requires importing the graph version with tag set `{"train"}`
in order to operate batch normalization in training mode, and setting
`trainable=True`.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this module, in order to accelerate training
on small datasets (or with huge batch sizes).
Advanced users can set another value (say, 0.997) by calling this module like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/3",
                    trainable=True, tags={"train"})
logits = module(inputs=dict(images=images, batch_norm_momentum=0.997),
                signature="image_classification_with_bn_hparams")
```

...or analogously for signature `image_feature_vector_with_bn_hparams`.


## Changelog

#### Version 1

  * Initial release.

#### Version 3

  * Support for variable input size.
  * Fine-tuning: change default batch norm momentum to 0.99 and
    make it configurable.
  * Requires PIP package `tensorflow-hub>=0.2.0`.
