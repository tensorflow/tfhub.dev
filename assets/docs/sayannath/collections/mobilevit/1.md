# Collection sayannath/mobilevit/1

Collection of MobileViT models.

<!-- dataset: imagenet-ilsvrc-2012-cls -->
<!-- task: image-classification -->

## Overview

This collection contains different MobileViT [1] models. For more details on the training protocols,
please follow [2]. The original model weights are provided from [2]. There were ported to Keras models
(`tf.keras.Model`) and then serialized as TensorFlow SavedModels. The porting steps are available in [4].
The models were directly pre-trained on ImageNet-1k. 

## About the models

Models included in this collection have two variants: (1) off-the-shelf inference for image
classification, (2) fine-tuning on downstream tasks. These models are accompanied by
Colab Notebooks for demonstration purposes. 

The table below provides a performance summary:

|      name     | original acc@1 | keras acc@1 |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| MobileViT_XXS |      69.0      |    68.58    |
|  MobileViT_XS |      74.7      |    74.67    |
|  MobileViT_S  |      78.3      |    78.38    |

Note that the top-1 accuracy is reported on the ImageNet-1k validation set. [This notebook](https://github.com/sayannath/MobileViT-GSoC/blob/main/imagenet_1k_eval/eval.ipynb) was used to get `keras acc@1` scores.
