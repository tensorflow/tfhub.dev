## TF2 SavedModel

This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2
format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model).
Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

## Overview

Inception V3 is a neural network architecture for image classification,
originally published by

  * Christian Szegedy, Vincent Vanhoucke, Sergey Ioffe, Jonathon Shlens,
    Zbigniew Wojna: ["Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer
    Vision"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567), 2015.

This TF Hub model uses the TF-Slim implementation of `inception_v3`.
The model contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to do the
[image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#classification)
that the network was trained on. If you merely want to transform images into
feature vectors, use
[`google/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/4`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/4)
instead, and save the space occupied by the classification layer.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this model was `inception_v3_2016_08_28/inception_v3.ckpt` downloaded
from
[TF-Slim's pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/README.md#pre-trained-models).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").


## Usage

This model can be used with the `hub.KerasLayer` as follows.
It *cannot* be used with the `hub.Module` API for TensorFlow 1.

```python
m = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/4")
])
m.build([None, 299, 299, 3])  # Batch input shape.
```

The output is a batch of logits vectors. The indices into the logits
are the `num_classes` = 1001 classes of the classification from
the original training (see above). The mapping from indices to class labels
can be found in the file at [download.tensorflow.org/data/ImageNetLabels.txt](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/ImageNetLabels.txt) (with class 0 for "background", followed by 1000 actual ImageNet classes).

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.
The expected size of the input images is
`height` x `width` = 299 x 299 pixels
by default, but other input sizes are possible (within limits).


## Fine-tuning

In principle, consumers of this model can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) it
by passing `trainable=True` to `hub.KerasLayer`.

However, fine-tuning through a large classification might be prone to overfit.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this model, in order to accelerate training
on small datasets (or with huge batch sizes).
Advanced users can set another value (say, 0.997) by loading this model like

```python
hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/4",
               trainable=True, arguments=dict(batch_norm_momentum=0.997))
```


## Changelog

#### Version 1

  * Initial release.

#### Version 3

  * Support for variable input size.
  * Fine-tuning: change default batch norm momentum to 0.99 and
    make it configurable.
  * Requires PIP package `tensorflow-hub>=0.2.0`.

#### Version 4

  * Switched to the SavedModel format of TensorFlow 2.
    The `hub.Module` class cannot load this or later versions any more.
