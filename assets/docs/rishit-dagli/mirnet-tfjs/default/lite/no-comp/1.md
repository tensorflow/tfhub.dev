### Overview
The MIRNet model proposed in Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement (Zamir et al.) [1] . The model can take a low-light image and enhance it to a great extent. The model has goals of maintaining high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving strong contextual information from the low-resolution representations. Here is an example result -
