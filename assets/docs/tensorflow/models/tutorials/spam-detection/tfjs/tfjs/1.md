# Tfjs tensorflow/tutorials/spam-detection/tfjs/1
The TF.js version of the SPAM-detection model

<!-- asset-path: internal -->
<!-- parent-model: tensorflow/tutorials/spam-detection/1 -->

## Overview

TF.js version of [SPAM Detection](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/tutorials/spam-detection/1).

## Usage

To use the model in TensorFlow.js, please check out the learning path at [link](https://www.google.com)

First you'll need to tokenize your input sentence with the dictionary provided by the model. This will turn your input sentence into an input tensor:

```js
/**
 * Function that takes an array of words, converts words to tokens,
 * and then returns a Tensor representation of the tokenization that
 * can be used as input to the machine learning model.
 */
function tokenize(wordArray) {
  // Always start with the START token.
  let returnArray = [DICTIONARY.START];

  // Loop through the words in the sentence we want to encode.
  // If word is found in dictionary, add that number else
  // we add the UNKNOWN token.
  for (var i = 0; i < wordArray.length; i++) {
    let encoding = DICTIONARY.LOOKUP[wordArray[i]];
    returnArray.push(encoding === undefined ? DICTIONARY.UNKNOWN : encoding);
  }

  // Finally if the number of words was < the minimum encoding length
  // minus 1 (due to the start token), fill the rest with PAD tokens.
  while (i < ENCODING_LENGTH - 1) {
    returnArray.push(DICTIONARY.PAD);
    i++;
  }

  // Log the result to see what we made.
  console.log([returnArray]);

  // Convert to a TensorFlow Tensor and return that.
  return tf.tensor([returnArray]);
}
```
