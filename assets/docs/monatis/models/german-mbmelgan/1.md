## Overview
This is a mel-to-speech model to be used for neural text-to-speech synthesis. You need a text-to-mel model, e.g. Tacotron 2 (also published on TF Hub), to get MEL spectagrams first. See [monatis/german-tts](https://github.com/monatis/german-tts) repo on GitHub for an end-to-end inference example.

## Dataset
I trained these models on [Thorsten dataset](https://github.com/thorstenMueller/deep-learning-german-tts) by Thorsten MÃ¼ller. It is licensed under the terms of Creative Commons Zero V1 Universal (CC0), which is used to opt out of copyright entirely and ensure that the work has the widest reach. Thanks [@thorstenMueller](https://github.com/thorstenMueller) for such a great contribution to the community.

## Notes
- I made use of [german_transliterate](https://github.com/repodiac/german_transliterate) For text preprocessing. Basically it normalizes numbers (e.g. converts digits to words), expands abbreviations and cares German umlauts and punctuations. For inference examples released in this repo, it is the only dependency apart from TensorFlow.
- You need to convert input text to numerical IDs to feed into the model. I am sharing a reference implementation for this in inference examples, and you need to code this logic to use the models in non-Python environments (e.g., Android).
