## Overview

The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high-dimensional vectors that
can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering and other
natural language tasks.

The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as
sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data
sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide
variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable length
English text and the output is a 512 dimensional vector. We apply this model to
the [STS benchmark](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) for
semantic similarity, and the results can be seen in the [example
notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb)
made available. The universal-sentence-encoder model is trained with a deep
averaging network (DAN) encoder.

To learn more about text embeddings, refer to the [TensorFlow Embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/embedding)
documentation. Our encoder differs from word level embedding models in that we
train on a number of natural language prediction tasks that require modeling the
meaning of word sequences rather than just individual words. Details are
available in the paper "Universal Sentence Encoder" [1].

#### Universal Sentence Encoder family

There are several versions of universal sentence encoder models trained with
different goals including size/performance multilingual, and fine-grained
question answer retrieval.

*   [universal-sentence-encoder-lite](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-qa](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-qa/2)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual/2)

#### Example use

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub

embed = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/3")
embeddings = embed([
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding"])["outputs"]

print(embeddings)

# The following are example embedding output of 512 dimensions per sentence
# Embedding for: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
# [-0.03133016 -0.06338634 -0.01607501, ...]
# Embedding for: I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding.
# [0.05080863 -0.0165243   0.01573782, ...]
```

This module is about 1GB. Depending on your network speed, it might take a while
to load the first time you run inference with it. After that, loading the model
should be faster as modules are cached by default
([learn more about caching](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model)). Further,
once a module is loaded to memory, inference time should be relatively fast.

#### Preprocessing

The module does not require preprocessing the data before applying the module,
it performs best effort text input preprocessing inside the graph.

## Semantic Similarity

![Semantic Similarity Graphic](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/universal-sentence-encoder/example-similarity.png)

Semantic similarity is a measure of the degree to which two pieces of text carry
the same meaning. This is broadly useful in obtaining good coverage over the
numerous ways that a thought can be expressed using language without needing to
manually enumerate them.

Simple applications include improving the coverage of systems that trigger
behaviors on certain keywords, phrases or utterances.
[This section of the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb#scrollTo=BnvjATdy64eR)
shows how to encode text and compare encoding distances as a proxy for semantic
similarity.

## Classification

![Text Classification Graphic](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/universal-sentence-encoder/example-classification.png)

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/tutorials/text_classification_with_tf_hub.ipynb)
shows how to train a simple binary text classifier on top of any TF-Hub module
that can embed sentences. The Universal Sentence Encoder was partially trained
with custom text classification tasks in mind. These kinds of classifiers can be
trained to perform a wide variety of classification tasks often with a very
small amount of labeled examples.
