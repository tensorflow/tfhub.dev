### Overview
The Faster RCNN model was proposed by Ren et al. in the paper "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks" [2]. The Faster RCNN models is trained on the CPPE - 5 dataset we present in our paper "CPPE - 5: Medical Personal Protective Equipment Dataset" [1] which is a new challenging dataset with an aim to facilitate the study of subordinate categorization of medical personal protective equipments. This dataset mostly contains non-iconic images or non-canonical perspectives in their natural context. This allows models to be better at generalizing, being easily deployable to real-world scenarios and often contain other objects in an image as well.

We include the training code as well some tools for this model in our paper GitHub repository [3].

### Note

- This model was _not_ quantized.
- This model takes fixed-shaped (800 x 1216) inputs.
- This model has been converted using the [TF Lite converter API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert).
