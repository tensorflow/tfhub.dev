## Overview

This model is a BiT-ResNet152x2 [1] trained on the ImageNet-1k dataset [2]. 

## Using this model

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/bit_r152x2_224_feature_extraction/1", trainable=True)
])
...
```

Inputs to the model must:
1. be four dimensional Tensors of the shape `(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`. Note that the model expects images with  `channels_last`  property. `height`,`width` and `batch_size` can be any value based on user's preference. `num_channels` must be 3. 
2. `height` and `width` should be 224.
3. have pixel values in the range `[-1, 1]`.


## Notes and acknowledgements

* The original model weights are provided as a `.npz` file [3]. There were ported to a TensorFlow SavedModel. The porting steps are available in [4].
* Thanks to [Willi Gierke](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/willi-gierke) for helping with porting the weights.
