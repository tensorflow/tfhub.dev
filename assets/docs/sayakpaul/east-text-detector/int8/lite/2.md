### Overview
EAST model was proposed [1]. It is one of the first end-to-end neural architectures that supported text detection from natural scenes. 

### Note
- This model was quantized using `int8` quantization (full `int8`) as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization#full_integer_quantization). [COCO-text](https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/coco-text-2/) dataset was used for this purpose. 
- The model is only capable of detecting text. To actually perform OCR, one can further process these results with a library like pytesseract. Refer to [this blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/17/opencv-ocr-and-text-recognition-with-tesseract/) post if you want to know more.
- Performance of the integer quantized model is not on par with the other two models (dynamic-range and float16). This has been already communicated to the TFLite team [via this issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/45958).
- The Colab Notebook contains further information on running this model in real-time settings.
- The original model weights were provided in [this blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/20/opencv-text-detection-east-text-detector/) post by PyImageSearch.
