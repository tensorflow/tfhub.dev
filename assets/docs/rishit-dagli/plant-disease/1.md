### TF2 SavedModel
This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model). Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

### Overview
This model classifies plant leaf images into 38 categories by species and disease. This model was trained on the [plant_village](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village) (Hughes et al.) dataset [1] on about 54,000 (+ augmented images) healthy and unhealthy leaf images. This model was trained on top of the MobileNet v2 model using weights from MobileNet trained on ImageNet. More info about using this model could be found in the below section.

Here are a couple of images from the dataset on which this model was trained on-

### Usage
This model can be used with the `hub.load` as follows.

```py
model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/plant-disease/1")
```

The output is a batch of logits vectors. The indices into the logits are the `num_classes = 38` classes of the classification from the original training (see above). The mapping from indices to class labels can be found in the file at https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/releases/download/v0.1.0/class_indices.json with each label in the following format: `${SPECIES}__${DISEASE}`. In case the disease name consists of two words it would be in the following format: `${DISEASE_WORD_1}_${DISEASE_WORD_2}`

The input images are expected to have color values in the range `[0,1]`, following the [common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input) conventions. The expected size of the input images is height x width = 224 x 224 pixels by default, but other input sizes are possible (within limits).
