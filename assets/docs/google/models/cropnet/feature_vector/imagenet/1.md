ImageNet feature vector model.

<!-- asset-path: internal -->
<!-- module-type: image-feature-vector -->

## Overview

This model returns a feature vector from a model that was trained to classify
[ImageNet (ILSVRC-2012-CLS)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenet2012).

### Input

This model takes images as input.

*   Expects a float input tensor of shape [batch size, 224, 224, 3].
*   Images are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_feature_vector`.

*   `image_feature_vector`: A float tensor of shape [batch size, 1280].

## Example use

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/cropnet/feature_vector/imagenet/1")
...
```

## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this model can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) it by
passing `trainable=True` to `hub.KerasLayer`.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this model, in order to accelerate training on
small datasets (or with huge batch sizes). Advanced users can set another value
(say, 0.997) by loading this model like

```python
hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/cropnet/feature_vector/imagenet/1",
               trainable=True, arguments=dict(batch_norm_momentum=0.997))
```
