## About Yolo-v5
 
YOLOv5 is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home) and significantly outperform its previous state-of-the-art yolo models.

- This model is trained on the COCO dataset.

- The TFLite model takes images as input and detects objects, makes bounding boxes and gives that image as output..

- Pre-trained Model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#pretrained-checkpoints)

- Model is quantized using `dynamic range` and `float16` quantization method as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- You can use [this](https://github.com/zldrobit/yolov5/tree/tf-android) to convert the pre-trained models to TFLite Format.

- You can use [Inference Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CBw3ifyrYiH4c9Uz65StpDroV5TOGLr9?usp=sharing) with TFLite Yolo-v5 model for object detection.
