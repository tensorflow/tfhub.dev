## Overview

### Module description

An image embedding model for Scandinavian fungi species. Trained on a dataset
provided by Danish Mycological Society.

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 299 x 299,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_feature_vector`.

*   **`image_feature_vector`**: Embedding feature vector of size 256.

## Usage

### Use SavedModel in Python

The model can be loaded in a Python script as follows:

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/svampeatlas/vision/embedder/fungi_V2/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

The input images are expected to have color values in the range [0,1], following
the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions. The input image size is 299x299 pixels.

Fine-tuning is not currently supported.

## Performance

### Online evaluation

Online evaluation was performed during training on the validation split (same
size as the training split).

At Step 39000, model performance is as follows:

*   **Recall@1**: 0.399
*   **Recall@5**: 0.60

### Training dataset

The weights for this module were obtained by training on the
[Scandinavian Fungi dataset](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/84d26682-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a),
provided by the [Danish Mycological Society (DMS)](http://www.svampe.dk/). This
dataset is available for use under the
*[CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)* license.

This dataset was curated by the DMS. Images in the dataset were obtained and
released by the DMS.

### Model architecture

This model is based on the inception_v4 architecture. Inception V4 is a neural
network architecture for image classification, originally published by

*   Christian Szegedy, Sergey Ioffe, Vincent Vanhoucke, Alex Alemi:
    [“Inception-v4, inception-resnet and the impact of residual connections on
    learning”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261), 2017.

### Additional information

Supports interactive model visualization.

## Suitable Use, Limitations, and Fair Use Terms

### Suitable use cases

This model is **suitable** for:

*   Retrieval of mushroom images from the Scandinavian region.

### Unsuitable use cases

This model is **unsuitable** for:

*   Distinguishing edible and inedible mushrooms.
*   Use in foraging applications.

### Limitations

*   This model may not generalize to cultivated or harvested mushrooms.
*   This model may not generalize to mushroom species common to other regions.
*   This model may not generalize to fungi species in non-user-captured images,
    such as museum specimens.
*   This model may not generalize to natural world species outside of the fungi
    kingdom.
