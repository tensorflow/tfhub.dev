# Module tensorflow/efficientnet/b6/feature-vector/1

Feature vectors of EfficientNet models trained on Imagenet (ILSVRC-2012-CLS).

<!-- dataset: imagenet-ilsvrc-2012-cls -->

## Note: requires TensorFlow 2.2+

This model requires TensorFlow 2.2 or newer, because it contains
a `FusedBatchNormV3` op with attr `exponential_avg_factor`.

## Overview

EfficientNets are a family of image classification models, which achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy, yet being an order-of-magnitude smaller and faster
than previous models.

We develop EfficientNets based on AutoML and Compound Scaling. In particular, we
first use
[AutoML MNAS Mobile framework](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/08/mnasnet-towards-automating-design-of.html)
to develop a mobile-size baseline network, named as `EfficientNet-B6`; Then, we
use the compound scaling method to scale up this baseline to obtain
`EfficientNet-B1` to `EfficientNet-B7`.

This TF-Hub module uses the Keras based implementation of
`EfficientNet-B6`. The default signature is used to get
[image feature vectors](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use module
[https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/b6/classification/1](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/b6/classification/1)
instead.

## Training

The weights for this module were obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet") with
[AutoAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501) preprocessing.

Please check out the
[TF Model Garden EfficientNet repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/image_classification)
for model training.

## Usage

This module implements the common signature for
[image feature-vector](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
It can be used like

```python
m = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/b6/feature-vector/1",
                   trainable=False),  # Can be True, see below.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
m.build([None, expect_img_size, expect_img_size, 3])  # Batch input shape.
```

For this module, the size of the input image is flexible, but it would be best
to match the model training input, which is `height` x `width` = 528 x 528
pixels for this model. The input `images` are expected to have color values in
the range [0,1], following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.

## Fine-tuning

This model can be used with the `hub.KerasLayer` as shown in the example. It
*cannot* be used with the `hub.Module` API for TensorFlow 1.
