# Updates to TensorFlow Hub Additional Terms of Service

On January 24, 2022, we updated our TensorFlow Hub Additional Terms of Service
("**Additional Terms**") to help clarify and make it easier to understand what
to expect as you use the service. These changes won't affect the way you use
TensorFlow Hub. You can access the Archived Terms
[here](./TERMS_ARCHIVE_202201.md).

At a glance, this update covers:

**More clarity on what to expect:**

We're providing more transparency about which terms apply to your use of
TensorFlow Hub, such as Google's Terms of Service ("**uTOS**") and Privacy
Policy. Those terms, along with these updated Additional Terms, provide clarity
on how we develop, improve, and update our service, including more detail about
the reasons we make changes and updates, and the advanced notice we provide to
you.

**General updates for improved readability:**

While our Additional Terms remain a legal document, we've done our best to make
them easier to understand. This includes:

-   reorganizing some sections (such as *Third Party Terms* and *Term and
    Termination*);
-   rewording others (such as *Use of Your Content, Intellectual Property* and
    *General Terms*); and
-   removing provisions that are already covered in the uTOS (such as *Account
    Terms*; certain provisions in the *Intellectual Property* section relating
    to ownership, trademarks, copyrights, feedback, and remedies; and certain
    *General Terms* relating to modifications to the agreement, confidential
    information, limitation of liability, indemnities, and other general terms)
    and providing helpful links to the uTOS provisions where applicable.

Please make sure you read the updates to the Additional Terms. By continuing to
use TensorFlow Hub after this date, you are agreeing to the updated Additional
Terms.

Thank you for being part of the TensorFlow community!
