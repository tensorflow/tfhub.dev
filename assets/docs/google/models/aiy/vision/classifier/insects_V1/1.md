## Overview

This model is trained to recognize 1021 insect species from images. It is based
on MobileNet, and trained on photos contributed by the iNaturalist community.

The species and images are a subset of the [iNaturalist 2017 Competition
dataset](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2017),
organized by [Visipedia](https://sites.google.com/corp/visipedia.org/index).
This model was originally published as part of the [Natural
Explorer](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/model/nature-explorer/) module for
Google's [AIY Vision Kit](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/vision/).

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 224 x 224,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_classifier`.

*   `image_classifier`: A probability vector of dimension 1022, corresponding
    to a `background` class and 1021 insect species in the [labelmap](
    https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/labelmaps/aiy_insects_V1_labelmap.csv).

## Example Use

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.Module('https://tfhub.dev/google/aiy/vision/classifier/insects_V1/1')
...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/aiy/vision/classifier/insects_V1/1')
...
```

## Model architecture

For details of the model architecture, see
[MobileNet V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

## Suitable usecases

*   This model is suitable for recognizing a well-cropped image of an insect.

## Unsuitable usecases

*   This model is not suitable for determining whether an insect is dangerous,
    or poisonous.
*   This model is not suitable for counting or population statistics (for
    instance, conclusively determining the presence of endangered species).
*   This model is not suitable for inferring the user's location based on which
    insects are visible.
