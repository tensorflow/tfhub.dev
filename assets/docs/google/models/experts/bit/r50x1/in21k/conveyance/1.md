## Overview

Expert representation obtained[1] by fine-tuning [BiT-m R50x1](https://tfhub.dev/google/bit/m-r50x1/1)
on the subtree "conveyance" of the "Full ImageNet, Fall 2011 release" dataset.


## Usage

```python
module = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bit/r50x1/in21k/conveyance/1")
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, 2048].
```


## Fine-tuning

Similar to [BiT-m R50x1](https://tfhub.dev/google/bit/m-r50x1/1), this model can be fine-tuned.


## Uses & Limitations

This model was further trained on the "conveyance" subtree of Imagenet and
may not generalize well to data that outside of that domain.
Accordingly, this gives more weight to individual data points and to those
concepts specific to the slice. Use of this model could inherit some of the
typical drawbacks of small, precise, and limited datasets, including
over-fitting or generalization problems.

You should evaluate any fairness and ethical considerations when applying this
model to a task, since the data this model was trained on may not be balanced
or representative of downstream applications. Instead of selecting a pre-trained
model based only on maximising accuracy, practitioners are encouraged to follow
[responsible AI practices](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/).
