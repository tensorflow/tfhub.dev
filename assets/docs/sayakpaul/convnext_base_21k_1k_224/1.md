## Overview

This model is a ConvNeXt [1] model pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset and was then fine-tuned on the ImageNet-1k dataset. You can find the complete
collection of ConvNeXt models on TF-Hub on [this page](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/collections/convnext/1).

## Using this model

```py
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/convnext_base_21k_1k_224/1", trainable=False)
])
predictions = model.predict(images)
```

Inputs to the model must:

1. be four dimensional Tensors of the shape `(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`. Note
that the model expects images with  `channels_last`  property. `num_channels` must be 3. 
2. be resized to 224x224 resolution.
3. be normalized with ImageNet-1k statistics.

Please refer to the Colab Notebook to know better.

## Notes

* The original model weights are provided from [2]. There were ported to Keras models
(`tf.keras.Model`) and then serialized as TensorFlow SavedModels. The porting
steps are available in [3].
* The model can be unrolled into a standard Keras model and you can inspect its topology.
To do so, first download the model from TF-Hub and then load it using `tf.keras.models.load_model`
providing the path to the downloaded model folder.
