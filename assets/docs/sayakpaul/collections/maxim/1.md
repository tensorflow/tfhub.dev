# Collection sayakpaul/maxim/1

Collection of MAXIM models pre-trained on several image processing datasets.

<!-- task: denoising -->
<!-- task: dehazing -->
<!-- task: deblurring -->
<!-- task: deraining -->
<!-- task: enhancement -->


## Overview

This collection contains the MAXIM models [1]. MAXIM family of models share a common
backbone and are capable of performing multiple image processing tasks: dehazing,
denoising, deblurring, deraining, and enhancement.

Following model checkpoints are available:

* [Low-light image enhancement](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-2_enhancement_lol/1)
* [Image retouching](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-2_enhancement_fivek/1)
* Image deblurring:

    * https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-3_deblurring_realblur_j/1
    * https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-3_deblurring_reds/1
    * https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-3_deblurring_gopro/1
* [Image denoising](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-3_denoising_sidd/1)
* Image dehazing
    * [Outdoors](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-2_dehazing_sots-outdoor/1)
    * [Indoors](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-2_dehazing_sots-indoor/1)
* Image deraining
    * https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-2_deraining_rain13k/1
    * https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/maxim_s-2_deraining_raindrop/1

These checkpoints were ported from the officially released JAX parameters [2] to TensorFlow. Porting code
is available in [3].
