## Overview

ResNet (later renamed ResNet V1) is a family of network architectures for
image classification with a variable number of layers, originally
published by

  * Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun: ["Deep Residual Learning
    for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), 2015.

This TF-Hub module uses the TF-Slim implementation of `resnet_v1_50`
with 50 layers.
The module contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to do the
[image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#classification)
that the network was trained on. If you merely want to transform images into
feature vectors, use module
[`google/imagenet/resnet_v1_50/feature_vector/1`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v1_50/feature_vector/1)
instead, and save the space occupied by the classification layer.


## Training

The weights for this module were obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet") with TF-Slim's "Inception-style"
preprocessing.


## Usage

This module implements the common signature for 
[image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#classification).
It can be used like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/resnet_v1_50/classification/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
logits = module(images)  # Logits with shape [batch_size, num_classes].
```

...or using the signature name `image_classification`. The indices into logits
are the `num_classes` = 1001 classes of the classification from
the original training (see above). The mapping from indices to class labels
can be found in the file at [download.tensorflow.org/data/ImageNetLabels.txt](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/ImageNetLabels.txt).

This module can also be used to compute [image feature
vectors](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector),
using the signature name `image_feature_vector`.

For this module, the size of the input image is fixed to
`height` x `width` = 224 x 224 pixels.
The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.


## Fine-tuning

In principle, consumers of this module can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#fine-tuning) it.
However, fine-tuning through a large classification might be prone to overfit.

Fine-tuning requires importing the graph version with tag set `{"train"}`
in order to operate batch normalization in training mode.
