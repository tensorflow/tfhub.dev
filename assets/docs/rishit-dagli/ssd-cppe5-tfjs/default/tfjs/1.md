# Tfjs rishit-dagli/ssd-cppe5-tfjs/default/1
TFJS version of the SSD model (with MobileNet backbone) trained on the CPPE - 5 (Medical Personal Protective Equipment) dataset [1].

### Overview
The SSD model was proposed by Liu et al. in the paper "Ssd: Single shot multibox detector" [2]. The SSD models is trained on the CPPE - 5 dataset we present in our paper "CPPE - 5: Medical Personal Protective Equipment Dataset" [1] which is a new challenging dataset with an aim to facilitate the study of subordinate categorization of medical personal protective equipments. This dataset mostly contains non-iconic images or or non-canonical perspectives in their natural context. This allows models to be better at generalizing, being easily deployable to real-world scenarios and often contain other objects in an image as well.

We include the training code as well some tools for this model in our paper GitHub repository [3].

### Usage
The saved model can be loaded directly:

```js
const model = await tf.loadGraphModel("https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/ssd-cppe5/default/tfjs/1")
```

The inputs to the models should:

- have color values in the range `[0,1]`, following the [common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input) conventions
- the expected size of the input images could be variable, but the model was trained on images of size `[640, 640]`
- the images should in the default `channels_last` format
- The shape of the input tensor would ths be `(1, -1, -1, 3)`, the first dimension represents the batch size

The model outputs are:

- `outputs['detection_anchor_indices']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100]` containing the anchor indices for each detection.
- `outputs['detection_boxes']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100, 4]` containing the boxes for each detection.
- `outputs['detection_classes']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100]` containing the class indices for each detection.
- `outputs['detection_multiclass_scores']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100, 6]` containing the class scores for each detection.
- `outputs['detection_scores']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100]` containing the scores for each detection.
- `outputs['num_detections']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size]` containing the number of valid detections in each image.

If use be the model also outputs the `raw_detection_boxes` and `raw_detection_scores` tensors.

### Note

- This model was _not_ quantized.
- This model takes variable shape inputs.
- This model has been converted using the [TensorFlow.js converter API](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/conversion).
