Image classification model based on NASNet-A.

<!-- module-type: image-classification -->
<!-- task: image-classification -->

## Overview

NASNet-A is a family of convolutional neural networks for image classification.
The architecture of its convolutional cells (or layers) has been found by
Neural Architecture Search (NAS). NAS and NASNet were originally published in
[1] and [2].
