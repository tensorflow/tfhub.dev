## Overview

This is the 512x512 *BigGAN* image generator described in [1], corresponding to
Row 5 in Table 2 (res. 512).

#### Example use
```python
# Load BigGAN 512 module.
module = hub.Module('https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-512/1')

# Sample random noise (z) and ImageNet label (y) inputs.
batch_size = 8
truncation = 0.5  # scalar truncation value in [0.02, 1.0]
z = truncation * tf.random.truncated_normal([batch_size, 128])  # noise sample
y_index = tf.random.uniform([batch_size], maxval=1000, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.one_hot(y_index, 1000)  # one-hot ImageNet label

# Call BigGAN on a dict of the inputs to generate a batch of images with shape
# [8, 512, 512, 3] and range [-1, 1].
samples = module(dict(y=y, z=z, truncation=truncation))
```

#### Note from the authors

This work was conducted to advance the state of the art in
generative adversarial networks for image generation.
We are releasing the pre-trained generator to allow our work to be
verified, which is standard practice in academia.
It does not include the discriminator to minimize the potential for
exploitation.
