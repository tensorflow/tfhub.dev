# Lite rishit-dagli/yolo-cppe5-lite/default/1
TF Lite version of the YOLO model (with DarkNet 53 backbone) trained on the CPPE - 5 (Medical Personal Protective Equipment) dataset [1].

### Overview
The YOLO model was proposed by Redmon et al. in their paper "Yolov3: An incremental improvement" [2]. The YOLO model is trained on the CPPE - 5 dataset we present in our paper "CPPE - 5: Medical Personal Protective Equipment Dataset" [1] which is a new challenging dataset with an aim to facilitate the study of subordinate categorization of medical personal protective equipments. This dataset mostly contains non-iconic images or non-canonical perspectives in their natural context. This allows models to be better at generalizing, being easily deployable to real-world scenarios and often contain other objects in an image as well.

We include the training code as well some tools for this model in our paper GitHub repository [3].

Note: In no case should this model be used to engage in any kind of high-risk activities, please [TF Hub Additional Terms of Service](https://tfhub.dev/terms#hra) for more information.

### Note

- This model was _not_ quantized.
- This model takes fixed-shaped (800 x 1216) inputs.
- This model has been converted using the [TF Lite converter API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert).
