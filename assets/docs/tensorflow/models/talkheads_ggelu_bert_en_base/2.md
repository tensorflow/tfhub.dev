## Overview

*BERT with Talking-Heads Attention and Gated GELU position-wise feed-forward
networks* is a Transformer Encoder for text that modifies the
[BERT architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
by using talking-heads attention (instead of multi-head attention) and
by using a gated linear unit with GELU activation as the first layer
of the position-wise feed-forward networks (instead of an ordinary dense layer)
as proposed by

  * Noam Shazeer, Zhenzhong Lan, Youlong Cheng, Nan Ding, Le Hou:
    ["Talking-Heads Attention"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02436), 2020.
  * Noam Shazeer:
    ["GLU Variants Improve Transformer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202),
    2020.

This model was implemented with code from the [TensorFlow Models
repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp)
using the `EncoderScaffold` with `GatedFeedforward` and `TalkingHeadsAttention`.
It uses L=12 hidden layers (i.e., Transformer blocks),
a hidden size of H=768 between the Transformer blocks
and 4H inside the position-wise feed-forward networks (like the original BERT,
so that the gated unit increases the total number of weights).
The number of attention heads is 12, identically for the
separate "heads dimensions" `h`, `h_k` and `h_v` from the Talking Heads paper.

This model has been pre-trained for English
on the Wikipedia and BooksCorpus.
Text inputs have been normalized the "uncased" way, meaning that the text has
been lower-cased before tokenization into word pieces, and any accent markers
have been stripped.

All parameters in the module are trainable, and fine-tuning all parameters is
the recommended practice.


## Usage

This SavedModel implements the encoder API for [text embeddings with transformer
encoders](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_saved_model_apis/text#transformer-encoders).
It expects a dict with three int32 Tensors as input:
`input_word_ids`, `input_mask`, and `input_type_ids`.

The separate **preprocessor** SavedModel at
[https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3)
transforms plain text inputs into this format, which its documentation
describes in greater detail.

### Basic usage

The simplest way to use this model in the
[Keras functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional)
is

```python
text_input = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)
preprocessor = hub.KerasLayer(
    "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3")
encoder_inputs = preprocessor(text_input)
encoder = hub.KerasLayer(
    "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/talkheads_ggelu_bert_en_base/2",
    trainable=True)
outputs = encoder(encoder_inputs)
pooled_output = outputs["pooled_output"]      # [batch_size, 768].
sequence_output = outputs["sequence_output"]  # [batch_size, seq_length, 768].
```

The encoder's outputs are the `pooled_output` to represents each input sequence
as a whole, and the `sequence_output` to represent each input token in context.
Either of those can be used as input to further model building.

To print pooled_outputs for inspection, the following code can be used:

```python
embedding_model = tf.keras.Model(text_input, pooled_output)
sentences = tf.constant(["(your text here)"])
print(embedding_model(sentences))
```

### Advanced topics

The [preprocessor documentation](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3)
explains how to input segment pairs and how to control `seq_length`.

The intermediate activations of all L=12
Transformer blocks (hidden layers) are returned as a Python list:
`outputs["encoder_outputs"][i]` is a Tensor
of shape `[batch_size, seq_length, 768]`
with the outputs of the i-th Transformer block, for `0 <= i < L`.
The last value of the list is equal to `sequence_output`.

The preprocessor can be run from inside a callable passed to
`tf.data.Dataset.map()` while this encoder stays a part of a larger
model that gets trained on that dataset.
The Keras input objects for running on preprocessed inputs are

```python
encoder_inputs = dict(
    input_word_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_mask=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_type_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
)
```

### Masked Language Model

This SavedModel provides a trainable `.mlm` subobject with predictions for the
Masked Language Model task it was originally trained with. This allows advanced
users to continue MLM training for fine-tuning to a downstream task. It extends
the encoder interface above with a zero-padded tensor of positions in the input
sequence for which the `input_word_ids` have been randomly masked or altered.
(See the [preprocessor model page](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3) for how to get the
id of the mask token and more.)

```python
mlm_inputs = dict(
    input_word_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_mask=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_type_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    masked_lm_positions=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(num_predict,), dtype=tf.int32),
)

encoder = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/talkheads_ggelu_bert_en_base/2")
mlm = hub.KerasLayer(encoder.mlm, trainable=True)
mlm_outputs = mlm(mlm_inputs)
mlm_logits = mlm_outputs["mlm_logits"]  # [batch_size, num_predict, vocab_size]
# ...plus pooled_output, sequence_output and encoder_outputs as above.
```
