## hub.Module for TF1

This is a hub.Module for use with TensorFlow 1.

## Overview

MobileNet V2 is a family of neural network architectures for efficient
on-device image classification and related tasks, originally published by

  * Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard, Menglong Zhu, Andrey Zhmoginov,
    Liang-Chieh Chen: ["Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks:
    Mobile Networks for Classification, Detection and
    Segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381), 2018.

Mobilenets come in various sizes controlled by a multiplier for the
depth (number of features) in the convolutional layers. They can also be
trained for various sizes of input images to control inference speed.

This TF-Hub module uses the TF-Slim implementation of
`mobilenet_v2`
with a depth multiplier of 0.75 and an input size of
96x96 pixels.
This implementation of Mobilenet V2 rounds feature depths to multiples of 8
(an optimization *not* described in the paper).
Depth multipliers less than 1.0 are not applied to the last convolutional layer
(from which the module takes the image feature vector).

The module contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use module
[`google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_075_96/classification/3`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_075_96/classification/3)
instead.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this module was `mobilenet_v2_0.75_96/mobilenet_v2_0.75_96.ckpt` downloaded
from
[MobileNet V2 pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet/README.md).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").

## Usage

This module implements the common signature for computing
[image feature vectors](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
It can be used with the `hub.Module` API like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_075_96/feature_vector/3")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

...or using the signature name `image_feature_vector`.
For use with TF2 APIs, see TF Hub's [migration
guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/migration_tf2.md).

The output for each image
in the batch is a feature vector of size `num_features` = 1280.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.
For this module, the size of the input images is fixed to
`height` x `width` = 96 x 96 pixels.


## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this module can [fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#fine-tuning) it.
This requires importing the graph version with tag set `{"train"}`
in order to operate batch normalization in training mode, and setting
`trainable=True`.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this module, in order to accelerate training
on small datasets (or with huge batch sizes).
Advanced users can set another value (say, 0.997) by calling this module like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_075_96/feature_vector/3",
                    trainable=True, tags={"train"})
features = module(inputs=dict(images=images, batch_norm_momentum=0.997),
                  signature="image_feature_vector_with_bn_hparams")
```
