# Placeholder tensorflow/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224/1

MobileNet V2 is a family of neural network architectures for efficient on-device
image classification, originally published by [1].

<!-- module-type: image-classification -->
<!-- task: image-classification -->


## Overview

Mobilenets come in various sizes controlled by a multiplier for the depth
(number of features) in the convolutional layers. They can also be trained for
various sizes of input images to control inference speed.

This model has been trained with depth multiplier 1.0 and has
input size 224x224 pixels.

This is a floating point model. Floating point models offer the best accuracy,
at the expense of model size and performance. GPU acceleration requires the
use of floating point models.
