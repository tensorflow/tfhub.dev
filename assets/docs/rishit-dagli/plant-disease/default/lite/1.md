[![Open Colab notebook]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/Greenathon-Plant-AI/blob/main/notebooks/plant_disease_TFLite.ipynb)

### Origin
This model is based on [rishit-dagli/plant-disease/1](https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/plant-disease/1/).

This model has been automatically converted using the [TF Lite converter API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert).

### Inputs
The input images are expected to have color values in the range `[0,1]`, following the [common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input) conventions. For this model, the size of the input images is fixed to `height` x `width` = 224 x 224 pixels.

### Outputs
A logits-vector with shape `\[batch_size, 38\]`, where 38 is the number of classes.
