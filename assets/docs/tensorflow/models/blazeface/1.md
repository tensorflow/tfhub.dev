## Overview

[Blazeface](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05047) makes use of the
[Single Shot Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) architecture with a
custom encoder. The model may serve as a first step for face-related computer
vision applications, such as facial keypoint recognition.

More background information about the model, as well as its performance
characteristics on different datasets, can be found here:

This model is available as part of
[MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/models), a
framework for building multimodal applied ML pipelines.
