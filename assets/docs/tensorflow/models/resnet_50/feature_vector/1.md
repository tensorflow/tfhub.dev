## TF2 SavedModel

This is a
[SavedModel in TensorFlow 2 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model).
Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

## Overview

ResNet is a family of network architectures for image classification, originally
published by

*   Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun:
    ["Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), 2015.

This TF Hub model uses the implementation of ResNet with 50 layers from
[tensorflow/models/official/vision/image_classification](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/vision/image_classification/resnet/resnet_model.py).
The model contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use
[`tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1`](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1)
instead.

## Training

The weights in this model have been obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").

This TF Hub model was built by
[tensorflow/models/official/vision/image_classification/tfhub_export.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/vision/image_classification/resnet/tfhub_export.py)
with `--model_path gs://cloud-tpu-checkpoints/resnet/resnet50/model.ckpt-0090`.

## Usage

This model can be used with the `hub.KerasLayer` as follows. It *cannot* be used
with the `hub.Module` API for TensorFlow 1.

```python
m = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/feature_vector/1",
                   trainable=False),  # Can be True, see below.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
m.build([None, 224, 224, 3])  # Batch input shape.
```

The output is a batch of feature vectors. For each input image, the feature
vector has size `num_features` = 2048. The feature vectors can then be used
further, e.g., for classification as above.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions. For this model, the size of the input images is fixed to `height` x
`width` = 224 x 224 pixels.

## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this model can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) it by passing
`trainable=True` to `hub.KerasLayer`.
