## Overview

The TRILLsson models are described in the publication `TRILLsson: Distilling Universal Paralingistic Speech Representations`. From audio, they generate
generally-useful paralinguistic speech representations (paralinguistics are
aspects of speech
other than text, such as emotion, language identification, synthetic or real,
etc). These representations are smaller, faster, and publicly available versions
of the state-of-the-art CAP12 embeddings, which are described in [Universal Paralinguistic Speech Representations Using Self-Supervised Conformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04621) (ICASSP 2022).

The TRILLssonN models range from 1-5. Lower numbers some from models that are
smaller and faster, but the representations are less powerful.

For more details, you can see the code that generated this model at our [github repo](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/non_semantic_speech_benchmark/trillsson).

###
Example use

```python
# TF1 version
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.load('https://tfhub.dev/google/trillsson5/1')
# NOTE: Audio should be floats in [-1, 1], sampled at 16kHz. Model input is of
# the shape [batch size, time].
audio_samples = tf.zeros([3, 64000])
embeddings = m(audio_samples)['embedding']
# Models internally aggregate over time. For a time-series of embeddings, the
# user can frame audio however they want.
embeddings.shape.assert_is_compatible_with([None, 1024])

# TF2 version
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/trillsson5/1')
# NOTE: Audio should be floats in [-1, 1], sampled at 16kHz. Model input is of
# the shape [batch size, time].
audio_samples = tf.zeros([3, 64000])
embeddings = m(audio_samples)['embedding']
# Models internally aggregate over time. For a time-series of embeddings, the
# user can frame audio however they want.
embeddings.shape.assert_is_compatible_with([None, 1024])
