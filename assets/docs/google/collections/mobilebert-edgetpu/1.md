# Collection google/mobilebert-edgetpu/1

MobileBert-EdgeTPU is a set of language pretraining models that are optimized
for Pixel 6.

<!-- dataset: wikipedia-and-bookscorpus -->
<!-- task: text-classification -->
<!-- network-architecture: mobilebert -->

## Overview

By co-designing the neural networks with the Edge TPU hardware accelerator in
[Tensor](https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/)
(Google's first phone SoC and the heart of Pixel 6), we have built
EdgeTPU-customized MobileBERT models that demonstrate datacenter model quality
meanwhile outperforms baseline MobileBERT's latency.

We set up our model architecture search space based on
[MobileBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02984) and leverage AutoML algorithms to
find models with up to 2x better hardware utilization. With higher utilization,
we are able to bring larger and more accurate models on chip, and meanwhile the
models can still outperform the baseline MobileBERT latency. The quantized
MobileBERT-EdgeTPU models (int8 quantized tflite will be available soon)
establish a new pareto-frontier for the question answering tasks and overshot
the accuracy of the float BERT_base model which is 400+MB and too large to run
on edge devices.
