## Overview
Computes contextualized word representations using character-based word
representations and bidirectional LSTMs, as described in the paper
"Deep contextualized word representations" [1].

This modules supports inputs both in the form of raw text strings or tokenized
text strings.

The module outputs fixed embeddings at each LSTM layer, a learnable aggregation
of the 3 layers, and a fixed mean-pooled vector representation of the input.

The complex architecture achieves state of the art results on several
benchmarks. Note that this is a very computationally expensive module compared
to word embedding modules that only perform embedding lookups. The use of an
accelerator is recommended.

#### Trainable parameters
The module exposes 4 trainable scalar weights for layer aggregation.

#### Example use
```
elmo = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/elmo/2", trainable=True)
embeddings = elmo(
    ["the cat is on the mat", "dogs are in the fog"],
    signature="default",
    as_dict=True)["elmo"]
```

```
elmo = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/elmo/2", trainable=True)
tokens_input = [["the", "cat", "is", "on", "the", "mat"],
                ["dogs", "are", "in", "the", "fog", ""]]
tokens_length = [6, 5]
embeddings = elmo(
    inputs={
        "tokens": tokens_input,
        "sequence_len": tokens_length
    },
    signature="tokens",
    as_dict=True)["elmo"]
```
We set the `trainable` parameter to `True` when creating the module so that
the 4 scalar weights (as described in the paper) can be trained. In this
setting, the module still keeps all other parameters fixed.

### Inputs
The module [defines two signatures](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#applying_a_module):
`default`, and `tokens`.

With the `default` signature, the module takes untokenized sentences as input.
The input tensor is a `string` tensor with shape `[batch_size]`. The module
tokenizes each string by **splitting on spaces**.

With the `tokens` signature, the module takes tokenized sentences as input.
The input tensor is a `string` tensor with shape `[batch_size, max_length]` and
an `int32` tensor with shape `[batch_size]` corresponding to the sentence
length. The length input is necessary to exclude padding in the case of
sentences with varying length.

### Outputs
The output dictionary contains:

* `word_emb`: the character-based word representations with shape
  `[batch_size, max_length, 512]`.
* `lstm_outputs1`: the first LSTM hidden state with shape
  `[batch_size, max_length, 1024]`.
* `lstm_outputs2`: the second LSTM hidden state with shape
  `[batch_size, max_length, 1024]`.
* `elmo`: the weighted sum of the 3 layers, where the weights are trainable.
  This tensor has shape `[batch_size, max_length, 1024]`
* `default`: a fixed mean-pooling of all contextualized word representations
  with shape `[batch_size, 1024]`.

## Changelog

#### Version 1
*  Initial release.

#### Version 2
*  Restricted trainable variables to the 4 scalar weights as described in the
paper.
