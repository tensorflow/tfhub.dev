### Notes

- This is a fully convolutional model with ResNet architecutre.

- As every column of the feature map there is a prediction, CTC is used to find the alignments between those predictions.

- While Converting to TFLite Format CTC Decoder part is removed from the model as it was not supported in TFLite Format. So we need to run explicitly decoder on output of the model for the final output. You can find the post-processing steps in the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tulasiram58827/ocr_tflite/blob/main/colabs/Deep_Text_Recognition_TFLite.ipynb)

- Model was quantized using `float16` quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- Original model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark)
