## Overview

### Module description

This is an embedding model for the fungi kingdom in the natural world, trained
on
[2018 FGVCx Fungi Classification Challenge](https://github.com/visipedia/fgvcx_fungi_comp)
dataset.

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 299 x 299,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_feature_vector`.

*   **`image_feature_vector`**: Embedding feature vector of size 64.

## Usage

### Use SavedModel in Python

The model can be loaded in a Python script as follows:

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/svampeatlas/vision/embedder/fungi_V1/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

The input images are expected to have color values in the range [0,1], following
the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions. The input image size is 299x299 pixels.

Fine-tuning is not currently supported.

## Performance

### Online evaluation

Online evaluation was performed during training on
[2018 FGVCx Fungi Classification Challenge](https://github.com/visipedia/fgvcx_fungi_comp)
validation dataset.

### Training dataset

The weights for this module were obtained by training on the
[2018 FGVCx Fungi Classification Challenge](https://github.com/visipedia/fgvcx_fungi_comp)
dataset, provided by [Danish Mycological Society](http://www.svampe.dk). This
dataset is available for use under the
*[CC BY-NC 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/)* license.

This dataset was curated by the Danish Mycological Society for FGVCx Fungi
competition in 2018. It contains over 100,000 images of 1500 mushroom species
most frequently observed in Denmark and neighboring Scandinavian countries.
Images in the dataset were captured by users of the Danish
[svampeatlas](https://svampe.databasen.org/) website, and annotations were
verified by mycology experts at the Danish Mycological Society.

### Model architecture

This model is based on the inception_v4 architecture. Inception V4 is a neural
network architecture for image classification, originally published by

*   Christian Szegedy, Sergey Ioffe, Vincent Vanhoucke, Alex Alemi:
    [“Inception-v4, inception-resnet and the impact of residual connections on
    learning”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261), 2017.

### Additional information

Supports interactive model visualization.

## Suitable Use, Limitations, and Fair Use Terms

### Suitable use cases

This model is **suitable** for:

*   Compute features on images of species in the fungi kingdom.

### Unsuitable use cases

This model is **unsuitable** for:

*   Distinguishing edible and inedible mushrooms.
*   Using in foraging applications.

### Limitations

*   This model may not generalize to cultivated or harvested mushrooms.
*   This model may not generalize to fungi species in non-user-captured images,
    such as museum specimens.
*   This model may not generalize to natural world species outside of the fungi
    kingdom.
