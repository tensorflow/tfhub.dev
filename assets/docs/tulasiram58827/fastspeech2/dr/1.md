## About FastSpeech2

Non-autoregressive text to speech (TTS) models such as FastSpeech can synthesize speech significantly faster than previous autoregressive models with comparable quality. 

- This model is trained on LJSpeech dataset.

- Pre-trained Model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS/)

- Model is quantized using `dynamic range` quantization method as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- You can use this [notebook](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS/blob/master/notebooks/TensorFlowTTS_FastSpeech_with_TFLite.ipynb) to convert the pre-trained models to TFLite Format.

- You can use [End to End Inference Notebook](https://github.com/tulasiram58827/TTS_TFLite/blob/main/End_to_End_TTS.ipynb) with Tacotron2, FastSpeech to generate speech from text.

- You can visit [TensorFlow TTS Repository](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS) for other TTS models.

- You can visit [TTS TFLite Repository](https://github.com/tulasiram58827/TTS_TFLite) for other TFLite models.
