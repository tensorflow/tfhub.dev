## Overview

TN-BERT is a modification of the BERT-base architecture that greatly compresses
the original BERT model using tensor networks. The dense feedforward layers are
replaced with Expand / Condense tn layers tuned to the TPU architecture.

This work is based on research conducted during the development of the
[TensorNetwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01330) Library. Check it out on
[github](https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork).

TN-BERT achieves the following improvements:

*   69M params, or 37% fewer than the original BERT base.

*   22% faster inference than the baseline model on TPUs.

*   Pre-training time under 8 hours on an 8x8 pod of TPUs.

*   15% less energy consumption by accellerators

## Usage

This model is built in TF2. It uses the same encoder API and basic structure as
the BERT-base model at:
[https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3)

The separate preprocessor SavedModel at
[https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3)
transforms plain text inputs into this format, which its documentation describes
in greater detail.

### Example use

This example uses TF2 in eager execution mode with the Keras API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import tensorflow_text as text  # Required by bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3
import numpy as np

text_input = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)
preprocessor = hub.KerasLayer(
    "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3")
encoder_inputs = preprocessor(text_input)
encoder = hub.KerasLayer(
    "https://tfhub.dev/google/tn_bert/1",
    trainable=True)
outputs = encoder(encoder_inputs)
pooled_output = outputs["pooled_output"]      # [batch_size, 768].
sequence_output = outputs["sequence_output"]  # [batch_size, seq_length, 768].

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=text_input, outputs=sequence_output)

# Inference
model(np.array(['This is a text sequence!']))
      # <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, seq_length, 768), dtype=float32>
```

The encoder's outputs are the pooled_output to represents each input sequence as
a whole, and the sequence_output to represent each input token in context.
