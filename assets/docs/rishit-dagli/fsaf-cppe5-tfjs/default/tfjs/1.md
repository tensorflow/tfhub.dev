# Tfjs rishit-dagli/fsaf-cppe5-tfjs/default/1
TFJS version of the FSAF model (with ResNeXt 101 backbone) trained on the CPPE - 5 (Medical Personal Protective Equipment) dataset [1].

### Overview
The FSAF model was proposed by Zhu et al. in their paper "Feature Selective Anchor-Free Module for Single-Shot Object Detection" [2]. The FSAF model is trained on the CPPE - 5 dataset we present in our paper "CPPE - 5: Medical Personal Protective Equipment Dataset" [1] which is a new challenging dataset with an aim to facilitate the study of subordinate categorization of medical personal protective equipments. This dataset mostly contains non-iconic images or non-canonical perspectives in their natural context. This allows models to be better at generalizing, being easily deployable to real-world scenarios and often contain other objects in an image as well.

We include the training code as well some tools for this model in our paper GitHub repository [3].

Note: In no case should this model be used to engage in any kind of high-risk activities, please [TF Hub Additional Terms of Service](https://tfhub.dev/terms#hra) for more information.

### Usage
The saved model can be loaded directly:

```js
const model = await tf.loadGraphModel("https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/fsaf-cppe5/default/tfjs/1")
```

The inputs to the models should:

- have color values in the range `[0,1]`, following the [common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input) conventions
- the expected size of the input images is height x width = 800 x 1216 pixels
- the images should in the `channels_first` format
- The shape of the input tensor would ths be `(1, 3, 800, 1216)`, the first dimension represents the batch size

The model outputs are:

- A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100, 5]` with the bounding boxes in normalized coordinates.
- A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100]` with the class labels for the bounding boxes.

### Note

- This model was _not_ quantized.
- This model takes fixed-shaped (800 x 1216) inputs.
- This model has been converted using the [TensorFlow.js converter API](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/conversion).
