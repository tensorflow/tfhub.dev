# Collection rishit-dagli/xcit/1
Collection of XCiT: Cross-Covariance Image Transformers models.

<!-- task: image-classification -->
<!-- network-architecture: xcit -->
<!-- dataset: imagenet -->

## Overview

The self-attention operation underlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e. words or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the local interactions of convolutions. The flexibility comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long sequences and high-resolution images this paper proposes a "transposed" version of self-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity in the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution images. [1]

## About the models

Models included in this collection have two variants: (1) off-the-shelf inference for image classification, (2) fine-tuning on downstream tasks. The table below provides a performance summary (ImageNet-1k validation set):
