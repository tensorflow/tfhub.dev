# Module sayannath/american-sign-language/1

The Image Scene Classification model can classify the images based on the american sign language alphabet. The model can handle upto 29 classes from A to Z and Space, Delete and Nothing as well.

## Overview

The American Sign Language Detection model is trained on MobileNetV2 architecture [1]. The dataset is imported from Kaggle [2]. The model can classifiy 29 classes which consists of A to Z, Space, Delete and Nothing as well.

### Note

This model is also loaded into Keras model. After you download the model, you can load the model using `tf.keras.models.load_model()`. You can quantise the model further.

```
Code snippet demonstrating use (e.g. for a TF model using the tensorflow_hub library)

import tensorflow_hub as hub

model = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/sayannath/american-sign-language/1")
```
