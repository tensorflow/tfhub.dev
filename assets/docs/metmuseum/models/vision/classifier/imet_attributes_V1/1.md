## Overview

This model is licensed under
[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), see below
for details.

### Module description

An image-based artwork attribute classifier, trained on
[iMet Collection 2019 Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00901.pdf)

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 299 x 299,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `prediction`.

*   **`prediction`**: A probabability vector of dimension 1103, each of which
    corresponds to an artwork attributes.

## Usage

### Use SavedModel in Python

The model can be loaded in a Python script as follows:

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/metmuseum/vision/classifier/imet_attributes_V1/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

The input images are expected to have color values in the range [0,1], following
the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions. The input image size is 299x299 pixels.

Fine-tuning is not currently supported.

## Training

### Training dataset

The weights for this module were obtained by training on the
[iMet Collection 2019 Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00901.pdf), provided
by [The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)](https://www.metmuseum.org/). This
dataset is available for use under the
*[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)* license.

This dataset was curated by The Met. Images in the dataset were obtained and
released under the effort of The Met's
[Open Access Program](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access).

### Model architecture

This model is based on the inception_v4 architecture. Inception V4 is a neural
network architecture for image classification, originally published by

*   Christian Szegedy, Sergey Ioffe, Vincent Vanhoucke, Alex Alemi:
    [“Inception-v4, inception-resnet and the impact of residual connections on
    learning”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261), 2017.

### Additional information

Supports interactive model visualization.
