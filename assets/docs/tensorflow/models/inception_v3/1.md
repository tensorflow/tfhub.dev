# Placeholder tensorflow/inception_v3/1
Image classification model based on Inception v3.

<!-- module-type: image-classification -->

## Overview

Inception V3 is a neural network architecture for image classification,
originally published in [1].

This is a floating point model. Floating point models offer the best accuracy,
at the expense of model size and performance. GPU acceleration requires the
use of floating point models.
