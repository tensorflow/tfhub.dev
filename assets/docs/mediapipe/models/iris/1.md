Real time eye tracking.

## Overview

Iris is a lightweight model for iris estimation, able to track landmarks
involving the iris, pupil and the eye contours using a single RGB camera.
Through use of iris landmarks, one may also determine the metric distance
between the subject and the camera with relative error of less than 10%. Note
that iris tracking does not infer the location at which people are looking, nor
does it provide any form of identity recognition.

For more information on the model, please refer to the
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11341).

For more information on how the model was trained and how it performs across
different groups, please refer to the

## Usage

The model takes as input a 64x64 image of an eye region.
