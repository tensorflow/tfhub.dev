Image classification model based on Inception v2.

<!-- asset-path: legacy -->
<!-- module-type: image-classification -->

## Overview

Inception V2 is a neural network architecture for image classification.
It builds on the Inception architecture originally published in [1].

Inception V2 uses are more powerful architecture made possible by
the use of batch normalization. Both were introduced in [2].

This model is quantized. Quantized image classification models offer the
smallest model size and fastest performance, at the expense of accuracy.
