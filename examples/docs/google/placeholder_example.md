# Overview

The placeholder is used to group different deployment formats of a model (TF.js,
TFLite) when the TF model itself is not present. Deployment formats are grouped
to the same placeholder by adding the parent-model tag in their markdown file.

The placeholder file should contain short description and metadata tags. For
example:

Token based text embedding trained on English Wikipedia corpus[1].
