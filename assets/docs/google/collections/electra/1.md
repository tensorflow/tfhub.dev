## Overview

ELECTRA is a BERT-like model that is pre-trained as a discriminator
in a set-up resembling a generative adversarial network (GAN).
ELECTRA (like BERT) computes dense vector representations for natural language
by using a deep neural network with the Transformer architecture.
It was originally published by:

## ELECTRA models

TF Hub offers several sizes of ELECTRA that package the original ELECTRA
checkpoints from
[Google Research](https://github.com/google-research/electra) as a
[TF2 SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model) using the
implementation of BERT from the
[TensorFlow Models repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp/bert).

  * [google/electra_small](https://tfhub.dev/google/electra_small)
  * [google/electra_base](https://tfhub.dev/google/electra_base)
  * [google/electra_large](https://tfhub.dev/google/electra_large)

These SavedModels implement the encoder API for [text embeddings with
transformer encoders](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_saved_model_apis/text#transformer-encoders).
Plain text input can be fed to them via the preprocessing model
(same for all sizes):

  * [tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess)

Please check the ELECTRA model docs for the exact version of preprocessing
to use, and general usage information.
