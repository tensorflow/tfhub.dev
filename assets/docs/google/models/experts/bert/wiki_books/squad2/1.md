## Overview

This model uses a BERT base architecture[1] initialized from https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/wiki_books/1 and fine-tuned on SQuAD 2.0[5] and was exported from code in the [TensorFlow Official Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp/bert).

This is a BERT base architecture but some changes have been made to the original training and export scheme based on more recent learnings. See the Datasets & Training section for more details.

## Tokenization

This model uses a tokenizer for transforming raw text into tokens that can be
fed to the model. The vocabulary for the tokenizer is the original BERT uncased WordPiece vocabulary generated from English Wikipedia[3] and BooksCorpus[4] datasets.

## Datasets & Training

This model was initialized from the https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/wiki_books/1 checkpoint and then fine-tuned on SQuAD 2.0 for 3 epochs with a batch size of 32 and
Adam optimizer using a 1e-4 learning rate. After training, the pooling layer is
replaced with an identity matrix before the model is exported which we have observed to be more stable during downstream tasks.

See https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/wiki_books/1 for more details on
pre-training.

The training was done using the `run_squad.py` script from the [TF
Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp/bert).

## Usage

```
!pip3 install --quiet sentencepiece
!pip3 install --quiet tf-models-official

import numpy as np
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import sentencepiece as spm
from official.nlp.bert import tokenization


# Define a helper function for converting sentences input ids, masks, and segment ids
def build_input(tokenizer, sentence, max_seq_length=512):
  """Generate (input_ids, input_mask, segment_ids) for a single sentence."""
  # Tokenize and
  tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(sentence)
  tokens = ["[CLS]"] + tokens + ["[SEP]"]
  ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)

  # Pad the ids to max sequence length
  pad_len = max_seq_length - len(ids)
  input_ids = ids + [0]*pad_len
  input_mask = [1]*len(ids) + [0]*pad_len

  # Single sentence segment_ids are all 0
  segment_ids = [0]*max_seq_length
  return (input_ids, input_mask, segment_ids)


# Define some sentences to feed into the model
sentences = [
  "Here We Go Then, You And I is a 1999 album by Norwegian pop artist Morten Abel. It was Abel's second CD as a solo artist.",
  "The album went straight to number one on the Norwegian album chart, and sold to double platinum.",
  "Ceylon spinach is a common name for several plants and may refer to: Basella alba Talinum fruticosum",
  "A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth.",
  "A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth.",
]

# Load the BERT model
bert = hub.load('https://tfhub.dev/google/experts/bert/wiki_books/squad2/1')

# Load the vocab file and configure the tokenizer
vocab_file = bert.vocab_file.asset_path.numpy()
tokenizer = tokenization.FullTokenizer(vocab_file, do_lower_case=bert.do_lower_case)

# Convert the sentences to bert inputs
inputs = [build_input(tokenizer, s) for s in sentences]

# Slice to batch each input tensor
input_ids = np.array([x[0] for x in inputs], dtype=np.int32)
input_masks = np.array([x[1] for x in inputs], dtype=np.int32)
segment_ids = np.array([x[2] for x in inputs], dtype=np.int32)

# Feed the inputs to the model to get the pooled and sequence outputs
pooled_output, sequence_output = bert([input_ids, input_masks, segment_ids])

print('\nSentences:')
print(sentences)
print('\nPooled outputs:')
print(pooled_output)
```

## Uses & Limitations

This model is intended to be used for a variety of English NLP tasks. This model was pre-trained on the English slice of Wikipedia[2] and BooksCorpus[3], so the
model is expected to perform well on English NLP tasks and is not expected to
perform well on text in other languages. The pre-training data contains more
formal text and the model may not generalize to more colloquial text such as
social media or messages.

This model is fine-tuned on the SQuAD 2.0 and is recommended for use in question answering tasks.

The fine-tuning task uses the SQuAD 2.0 dataset as a span-labeling task to label the answer to a question in a given context. This model may not perform well on tasks unrelated to question answering.

BERT models fine-tuned on different datasets.

## Evaluation

We provide the results of fine-tuning this model on a set of downstream tasks.
The model is trained 5 times on each downstream dataset and the metrics are
reported here with the median value highlighted along with other BERT experts
trained on different datasets.
