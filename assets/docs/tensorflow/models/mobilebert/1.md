## Overview

This model is a compressed version of BERT - MobileBERT - that runs 4x faster
and has 4x smaller model size. BERT is a deep bidirectional transformer
trained on Wikipedia and the BookCorpus. The details are described in the paper
"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language
Understanding" [1].

MobileBERT is further trained on
[SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/), or Stanford Question
Answering Dataset which is a reading comprehension dataset consisting of
articles from Wikipedia and a set of question-answer pairs for each article.

The MobileBERT Q&A model takes a passage and a question as input, then returns a
segment of the passage that most likely answers the question. It requires
semi-complex pre-processing including tokenization and post-processing steps
that are described in the BERT [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and
implemented in the sample app.

To use the WordPiece tokenizer for pre-processing, you need the
[vocabulary file](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/bert_qa/vocab.txt).
