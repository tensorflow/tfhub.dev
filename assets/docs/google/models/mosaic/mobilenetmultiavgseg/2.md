# Module google/mosaic/mobilenetmultiavgseg/2

MOSAIC is a neural network architecture for efficient and accurate semantic
image segmentation on mobile devices.

## Overview

MOSAIC is designed using commonly supported neural operations by diverse mobile
hardware platforms for flexible deployment across various mobile platforms.
MOSAIC achieves a 5% absolute accuracy gain on ADE20K with similar or lower
latency compared to the current industry standard MLPerf mobile v1.0 models and
state-of-the-art architectures.

MLPerf Mobile v2.0 included MOSAIC as a new industry standard benchmark model
for image segmentation. Please see details [here](https://mlcommons.org/en/news/mlperf-inference-1q2022/).

This TF Hub model uses the implementation from the
[TensorFlow Model Garden GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/mosaic),
and achieves 77.24% mIoU on Cityscapes dataset (full resolution) with 19
classes.

### Example use

The example usage is

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

IMAGE_HEIGHT = 1024
IMAGE_WIDTH = 2048

# Download the model from Tensorflow Hub.
keras_layer = hub.KerasLayer(
  'https://tfhub.dev/google/mosaic/mobilenetmultiavgseg/2',
  signature='serving_default',
  output_key='logits')
model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras_layer])
model.build([None, IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, 3])

images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, 3].

# Run segmentation.
output_data = model(images)
```

Note that the output_data is a dictionary with key: 'logits', and
`output_data['logits']` is in the shape of [batch_size, height, width,
num_classes], which is the raw logits prediction output for each pixel.

### Training

Please check out the [TF Model Garden MOSAIC implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/mosaic) for model training.
