Image classification model based on Inception v1.

<!-- module-type: image-classification -->

## Overview

Inception V1 (a.k.a. GoogLeNet) is a neural network architecture
for image classification, originally published in [1].

This model is quantized. Quantized image classification models offer the
smallest model size and fastest performance, at the expense of accuracy.
