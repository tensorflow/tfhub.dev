### TF2 SavedModel
This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model). Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

### Overview
The MIRNet model proposed in Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement (Zamir et al.) [1] . The model can take a low-light image and enhance it to a great extent. The model has goals of maintaining high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving strong contextual information from the low-resolution representations. Here are a couple of result -
