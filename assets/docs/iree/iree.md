IREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment1) is an MLIR-based
end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a
unified IR that scales up to meet the needs of the datacenter and down to
satisfy the constraints and special considerations of mobile and edge
deployments.
