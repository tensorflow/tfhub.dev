A person segmentation model.

<!-- module-type: image-segmentation -->
<!-- task: image-segmentation -->

## Overview
This model can be used to segment an image into pixels that are and are not part
of a person, and into pixels that belong to each of twenty-four body parts. It
works for a single person, and its ideal use case is for when there is only one
person centered in an input image or video.

BodyPix comes with a few different versions of the model, each corresponding to
a MobileNet v1 architecture with a specific multiplier.

This model comes with multiplier `0.25` - recommended for mobile.
