## Overview

Boundless Model for image extrapolation. This model takes an image, internally
masks the right quarter, and completes the masked portion. For details please
refer to [1].

### Example use

Here is one way to use these models, please refer to [2] for a complete guide to
tf.Hub.

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.Module('https://tfhub.dev/google/boundless/quarter/1')

outputs = m(images, as_dict=True)
masked_image = outputs["masked_image"]
completed_image = outputs["default"]

...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/boundless/quarter/1')

completed_image = m(images)

```

### Limitations

Use of this model for human images is not recommended due to poor quality.
