### Overview
The original Boundless model is proposed in [1]. The model can take an input image (preferably natural images), internally mask a specific portion of the image, and extrapolate the mask portion keeping consistent semantics. The particular variant masks 1/4th of the input image. Here is an example result -

### Note
- Pre-trained weights of the model come from [here](https://tfhub.dev/google/boundless/quarter/1). 
- This model was quantized using _dynamic range quantization_ as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).
- This model is populated with metadata.
- The Colab Notebook that accompanies the model contains conversion and inference steps.
