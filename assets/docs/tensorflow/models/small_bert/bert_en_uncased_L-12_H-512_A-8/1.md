## Overview

This is one of the smaller BERT models referenced in
[Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the
Importance of Pre-training Compact Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962),
republished for use with TensorFlow 2.

We have shown that the standard BERT recipe (including model architecture and
training objective) is effective on a wide range of model sizes, beyond
BERT-Base and BERT-Large. The smaller BERT models are intended for environments
with restricted computational resources. They can be fine-tuned in the same
manner as the original BERT models. However, they are most effective in the
context of knowledge distillation, where the fine-tuning labels are produced by
a larger and more accurate teacher.

Our goal is to enable research in institutions with fewer computational
resources and encourage the community to seek directions of innovation
alternative to increasing model capacity.

This TF Hub model uses the implementation of BERT from the
TensorFlow Models repository on GitHub at
[tensorflow/models/official/nlp/bert](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp/bert).
It uses L=12 hidden layers (i.e., Transformer blocks),
a hidden size of H=512,
and A=8 attention heads.
For other model sizes, see the
[BERT](https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/bert/1) collection.

The weights of this model are unchanged from its original release for
TensorFlow 1. This model has been pre-trained for English
on the Wikipedia and BooksCorpus.
Text inputs have been normalized the "uncased" way, meaning that the text has
been lower-cased before tokenization into word pieces, and any accent markers
have been stripped. For training, random input masking has been applied independently to word pieces
(as in the original BERT paper).

All parameters in the module are trainable, and fine-tuning all parameters is
the recommended practice.


## Usage

This SavedModel implements the encoder API for [text embeddings with transformer
encoders](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_saved_model_apis/text#transformer-encoders).
It expects a dict with three int32 Tensors as input:
`input_word_ids`, `input_mask`, and `input_type_ids`.

The separate **preprocessor** SavedModel at
[https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3)
transforms plain text inputs into this format, which its documentation
describes in greater detail.

### Basic usage

The simplest way to use this model in the
[Keras functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional)
is

```python
text_input = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)
preprocessor = hub.KerasLayer(
    "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3")
encoder_inputs = preprocessor(text_input)
encoder = hub.KerasLayer(
    "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/small_bert/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-512_A-8/1",
    trainable=True)
outputs = encoder(encoder_inputs)
pooled_output = outputs["pooled_output"]      # [batch_size, 512].
sequence_output = outputs["sequence_output"]  # [batch_size, seq_length, 512].
```

The encoder's outputs are the `pooled_output` to represents each input sequence
as a whole, and the `sequence_output` to represent each input token in context.
Either of those can be used as input to further model building.

To print pooled_outputs for inspection, the following code can be used:

```python
embedding_model = tf.keras.Model(text_input, pooled_output)
sentences = tf.constant(["(your text here)"])
print(embedding_model(sentences))
```

### Advanced topics

The [preprocessor documentation](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3)
explains how to input segment pairs and how to control `seq_length`.

The intermediate activations of all L=12
Transformer blocks (hidden layers) are returned as a Python list:
`outputs["encoder_outputs"][i]` is a Tensor
of shape `[batch_size, seq_length, 512]`
with the outputs of the i-th Transformer block, for `0 <= i < L`.
The last value of the list is equal to `sequence_output`.

The preprocessor can be run from inside a callable passed to
`tf.data.Dataset.map()` while this encoder stays a part of a larger
model that gets trained on that dataset.
<!--- TODO(b/171934083): Link to an example Colab. --->
The Keras input objects for running on preprocessed inputs are

```python
encoder_inputs = dict(
    input_word_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_mask=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_type_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
)
```

### Masked Language Model

This SavedModel provides a trainable `.mlm` subobject with predictions for the
Masked Language Model task it was originally trained with. This allows advanced
users to continue MLM training for fine-tuning to a downstream task. It extends
the encoder interface above with a zero-padded tensor of positions in the input
sequence for which the `input_word_ids` have been randomly masked or altered.
(See the [preprocessor model page](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3) for how to get the
id of the mask token and more.)

```python
mlm_inputs = dict(
    input_word_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_mask=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    input_type_ids=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(seq_length,), dtype=tf.int32),
    masked_lm_positions=tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(num_predict,), dtype=tf.int32),
)

encoder = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/small_bert/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-512_A-8/1")
mlm = hub.KerasLayer(encoder.mlm, trainable=True)
mlm_outputs = mlm(mlm_inputs)
mlm_logits = mlm_outputs["mlm_logits"]  # [batch_size, num_predict, vocab_size]
# ...plus pooled_output, sequence_output and encoder_outputs as above.
```
