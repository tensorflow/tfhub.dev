## Overview

The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high-dimensional vectors that
can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering and other
natural language tasks.

The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as
sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data
sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide
variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable length
English text and the output is a 512 dimensional vector. We apply this model to
the [STS benchmark](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) for
semantic similarity, and the results can be seen in the [example
notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/50bbebaa248cff13e82ddf0268ed1b149ef478f2/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb)
made available. The universal-sentence-encoder model is trained with a deep
averaging network (DAN) encoder.

To learn more about text embeddings, refer to the [TensorFlow Embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/embedding)
documentation. Our encoder differs from word level embedding models in that we
train on a number of natural language prediction tasks that require modeling the
meaning of word sequences rather than just individual words. Details are
available in the paper "Universal Sentence Encoder" [1].

#### Universal Sentence Encoder family

There are several versions of universal sentence encoder models trained with
different goals including size/performance multilingual, and fine-grained
question answer retrieval.

*   [universal-sentence-encoder-large](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/3)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-lite](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual/1)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-large](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-large/1)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-qa](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-qa/1)

#### Example use

```python
embed = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2")
embeddings = embed([
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding"])

print(session.run(embeddings))

# The following are example embedding output of 512 dimensions per sentence
# Embedding for: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
# [-0.016987282782793045, -0.008949815295636654, -0.0070627182722091675, ...]
# Embedding for: I am a sentence for which I would like to get its embedding.
# [0.03531332314014435, -0.025384284555912018, -0.007880025543272495, ...]
```

This module is about 1GB. Depending on your network speed, it might take a while
to load the first time you run inference with it. After that, loading the model
should be faster as modules are cached by default
([learn more about caching](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module)). Further,
once a module is loaded to memory, inference time should be relatively fast.

#### Preprocessing

The module does not require preprocessing the data before applying the module,
it performs best effort text input preprocessing inside the graph.

## Semantic Similarity

![Semantic Similarity Graphic](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/universal-sentence-encoder/example-similarity.png)

Semantic similarity is a measure of the degree to which two pieces of text carry
the same meaning. This is broadly useful in obtaining good coverage over the
numerous ways that a thought can be expressed using language without needing to
manually enumerate them.

Simple applications include improving the coverage of systems that trigger
behaviors on certain keywords, phrases or utterances.
[This section of the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/50bbebaa248cff13e82ddf0268ed1b149ef478f2/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb#scrollTo=BnvjATdy64eR)
shows how to encode text and compare encoding distances as a proxy for semantic
similarity.

## Classification

![Text Classification Graphic](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/universal-sentence-encoder/example-classification.png)

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/50bbebaa248cff13e82ddf0268ed1b149ef478f2/docs/tutorials/text_classification_with_tf_hub.ipynb)
shows how to train a simple binary text classifier on top of any TF-Hub module
that can embed sentences. The Universal Sentence Encoder was partially trained
with custom text classification tasks in mind. These kinds of classifiers can be
trained to perform a wide variety of classification tasks often with a very
small amount of labeled examples.

## Known issues

* This module does not work with GPU starting with TF 1.8 ([github issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/issues/160)). The problem **can be avoided** by:
  *  Using a **tf-nightly-gpu** past the commit fixing this bug (1.14.1.dev20190504).
  *  Turning off the affected Grappler optimization:

```python
config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.graph_options.rewrite_options.shape_optimization = 2
session = tf.Session(config=config)
```

## Changelog

#### Version 1
*  Initial release.

#### Version 2
*  Exposed internal variables as Trainable.
