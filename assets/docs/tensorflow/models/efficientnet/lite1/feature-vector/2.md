# Module tensorflow/efficientnet/lite1/feature-vector/2

EfficientNet-Lite model, trained on Imagenet (ILSVRC-2012-CLS), optimized for
TFLite, designed for performance on mobile CPU, GPU, and EdgeTPU.

## Overview

EfficientNet-Lite are a family of mobile/IoT-friendly image classification
models. They are derived from the EfficientNet architecture originally published
as:

*   Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le:
    [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946),
    ICML 2019.

EfficientNet-Lite runs well on all mobile CPU/GPU/EdgeTPU hardware and is not
specialized to EdgeTPU.

Due to the requirements from edge devices, we mainly made the following changes
based on the original EfficientNets.

* Remove squeeze-and-excite (SE): SE are not well supported for some mobile
  accelerators.
* Replace all swish with RELU6: for easier post-quantization.
* Fix the stem and head while scaling models up: for keeping models small and
  fast.

## Training

### Training EfficientNet-lite on Cloud TPUs
Please refer to our tutorial: [https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/efficientnet](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/efficientnet)

### Post-training quantization

```shell
$ export MODEL=efficientnet-lite0
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-tpu-checkpoints/efficientnet/${MODEL}.tar.gz
$ tar zxf ${MODEL}.tar.gz
$ python export_model.py --model_name=$MODEL --ckpt_dir=$MODEL --data_dir=/path/to/representative_dataset/ --output_tflite=${MODEL}_quant.tflite
```

To produce a float model that bypasses the post-training quantization:

```shell
$ python export_model.py --model_name=$MODEL --ckpt_dir=$MODEL --output_tflite=${MODEL}_float.tflite --quantize=False
```

The `export_model.py` script can also be used to export a
[tensorflow saved_model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) from a
training checkpoint:

```shell
$ python export_model.py --model_name=$MODEL --ckpt_dir=/path/to/model-ckpt/ --output_saved_model_dir=/path/to/output_saved_model/ --output_tflite=${MODEL}_float.tflite --quantize=False
```

## Usage

This module implements the common signature for
[image feature-vector](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
It can be used like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/lite1/feature-vector/2")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

...or using the signature name `image_feature-vector`.

For this module, the size of the input image is flexible, but it would be best
to match the model training input, which is
`height` x `width` = 240 x 240 pixels for this model. The input
`images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1], following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.

## Fine-tuning

In principle, consumers of this module can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#fine-tuning) it.
However, fine-tuning through a large classification might be prone to overfit.

Fine-tuning requires importing the graph version with tag set `{"train"}` in
order to operate batch normalization in training mode.

## Changelog

#### Version 1
* Initial release.

#### Version 2
* Change variable with shape (1, 1, 3) to scalar for normalization. This should make the model run faster on CPU and be compatible with GPU.
