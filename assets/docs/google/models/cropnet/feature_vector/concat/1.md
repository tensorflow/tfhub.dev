## Overview

This model returns a feature vector from a model that was trained to classify a
concatenation of
[iNaturalist](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/i_naturalist2017) and
plants subset of ImageNet-21K (also known as the "Full ImageNet, Fall 2011
release").

The plants subset of ImageNet-21K has 1.57M images and 3775 classes. It consists
of images with labels that have the synset plant.n.02 as a hypernym in the
[WordNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet) graph. In total the
concatenated dataset has 2.15M images and 8864 classes.

### Input

This model takes images as input.

*   Expects a float input tensor of shape [batch size, 224, 224, 3].
*   Images are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_feature_vector`.

*   `image_feature_vector`: A float tensor of shape [batch size, 1280].

## Example use

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/cropnet/feature_vector/concat/1")
...
```

## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this model can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) it by
passing `trainable=True` to `hub.KerasLayer`.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this model, in order to accelerate training on
small datasets (or with huge batch sizes). Advanced users can set another value
(say, 0.997) by loading this model like

```python
hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/cropnet/feature_vector/concat/1",
               trainable=True, arguments=dict(batch_norm_momentum=0.997))
```
