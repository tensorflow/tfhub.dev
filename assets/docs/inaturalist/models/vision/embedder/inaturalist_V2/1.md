## Overview

### Module description

An image embedding model for natural world entities, trained on
[iNaturalist 2018 May Dataset](https://doi.org/10.15468/ab3s5x)
dataset.

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 299 x 299,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_feature_vector`.

*   **`image_feature_vector`**: Embedding feature vector of size 64.

## Usage

### Use SavedModel in Python

The model can be loaded in a Python script as follows:

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/inaturalist/vision/embedder/inaturalist_V2/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

The input images are expected to have color values in the range [0,1], following
the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions. The input image size is 299x299 pixels.

Fine-tuning is not currently supported.

This dataset was curated by iNaturalist. Images in the dataset were captured by
citizen scientists using the iNaturalist platform. Only
[research-grade](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/help#quality)
observations were exported to this dataset.

### Model architecture

This model is based on the inception_v4 architecture. Inception V4 is a neural
network architecture for image classification, originally published by

*   Christian Szegedy, Sergey Ioffe, Vincent Vanhoucke, Alex Alemi:
    [“Inception-v4, inception-resnet and the impact of residual connections on
    learning”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261), 2017.

### Additional information

Supports interactive model visualization.

## Suitable Use, Limitations, and Fair Use Terms

### Suitable use cases

This model is **suitable** for:

*   Compute features on images of natural world entities.

### Unsuitable use cases

This model is **unsuitable** for:

*   Detection and identification of endangered species.
*   Detection and identification of humans.
*   Detection and identification of edible species.
*   Detection and identification of species which are potentially harmful to
    humans.

### Limitations

*   This model may not generalize to commercial plants and cultivated crops.
*   This model may not generalize to dog and cat breeds.
*   This model may not generalize to species in non-user-captured images, such
    as museum specimens.
