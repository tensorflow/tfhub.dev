# Lite sayannath/zero-dce/1
TF Lite version of the Zero-DCE model to enhance a low-light image.

### Overview
The model can take a low-light image and enhance it to a great extent. Here is an example result -

### Note
- This model takes fixed-shaped (400x600) inputs (images with RGB channel ordering).
- The Colab Notebook that accompanies the model contains conversion and inference steps.

### Acknowledgements
Soumik trained the original model that was used for generating the TensorFlow Lite models. Soumik's code repository is available [here](https://github.com/soumik12345/Zero-DCE).
