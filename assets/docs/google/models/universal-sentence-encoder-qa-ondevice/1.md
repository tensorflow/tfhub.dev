Greater-than-word length text encoder for on-device question answer retrieval.

<!-- fine-tunable: false -->

<!-- network-architecture: Transformer -->
<!-- format: saved_model -->

### Model Details

*   Developed by researchers at Google, 2019. See QALite in [1].
*   Transformer.
*   Strong performance on question answer retrieval for English.
*   *All input text needs to be preprocessed with SentencePiece tokenizer and
    padded to a fixed length of 192.* Any input longer than 192 tokens are
    truncated from the right. Thus, the model time and space complexity is
    fixed. We recommend question and response inputs that are approximately one
    sentence in length.
*   Use the __pretokenized_inputs:query_encoder__ signature to encode questions
    in any of the aforementioned languages and the output is a 100 dimensional
    vector.
*   Use the __pretokenized_inputs:response_encoder__ signture to encode the
    answers and the output is a 100 dimensiaonal vector.This signature acceptes
    two input fields:
    *   __text__: the answer text.
    *   __context__: usually the text around the answer text, for example it
        could be 2 sentences before plus 2 sentences after, it could also be the
        paragraph conaining the answer text. If you don't have context to
        include, you can duplicate of answer into this field.

To learn more about text embeddings, refer to the
[TensorFlow Embeddings](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings)
documentation.

### Intended Use

*   It is trained on a variety of data sources, with the goal of
    learning text representations that are useful out-of-the-box to retrieve an
    answer given a question.
*   It can also be used in other applications, including any type of text
    classification, clustering, etc.

### A Word About Biases in Language Understanding Models…

Language understanding models use millions of examples to learn about language
and how words and sentences relate to each other. What they learn can be used to
power applications relevant to communication in society, and can also reflect
human cognitive biases.

When using any NLU model, including this one, careful product design decisions
are critical. For example, a toxicity classifier or sensitive topics classifier
could determine when an input or the output may be objectionable or contain an
unwanted association. We recommend taking bias-impact mitigation steps if
applicable to your application.

#### Universal Sentence Encoder family

There are several versions of universal sentence encoder models trained with
different goals including size/performance multilingual, and fine-grained
question answer retrieval.

*   [universal-sentence-encoder](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/3)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-large](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/4)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-lite](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual/2)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-large](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-large/2)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-qa](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-multilingual-qa/2)
*   [universal-sentence-encoder-qa](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-qa/2)

### Metrics

*   We tested this model with
    [SQuAD retrieval task](https://github.com/google/retrieval-qa-eval). See
    performance below:

    SQuAD Retrieval | dev  | train
    :-------------- | :--: | ----:
    Precision@1     | 39.5 | 30.1

#### Prerequisites

This module takes SentencePiece preprocessed token IDs as input. Please refer to
the [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) for detail. On
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), the SentencePiece
library is available by:

```python
!pip install sentencepiece
```

### Example use

```python
import numpy as np
import sentencepiece as spm
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf

SAVEDMODEL_DIR = '/path/to/your/saved/model/directory'
SPM_MODEL = "/path/to/your/sentencepiece/model"
QUERY = "How are you feeling today?"
RESPONSES = [
    ("I'm not feeling very well.", ""),
    ("Beijing is the capital of China.", ""),
    ("You have five fingers on your hand.", ""),
]
