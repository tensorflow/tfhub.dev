## Overview
This model is a Video Swin Transformer [1] pre-trained on the ImageNet-22K dataset and was then fine-tuned on Kinetics 400(22k) dataset. You can find the complete
collection of Swin models on TF-Hub on [this page](https://tfhub.dev/shoaib6174/collections/video-swin-transformer).
You can use this model for feature extraction. Please refer to
the Colab Notebook linked on this page for more details.

#### Example use

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/shoaib6174/swin_base_patch244_window877_kinetics400_22k/1")

shape_of_input = [1,3,32,224,224]   # [batch_size, channels, frames, height, width]
dummy_video = tf.random.normal(shape_of_input)

output = model(dummy_video)

print(output.shape)

# The output shape of the example will be [1,768*******]
```


## Notes
* The original model weights are provided from [2]. They were ported to Keras models
(`tf.keras.Model`) and then serialized as TensorFlow SavedModels. The porting
steps are available in [3].
* The model can be unrolled into a standard Keras model and you can inspect its topology.
To do so, first download the model from TF-Hub and then load it using `tf.keras.models.load_model`
providing the path to the downloaded model folder.
