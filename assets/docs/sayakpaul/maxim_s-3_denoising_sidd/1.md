## Overview

This model is based on the MAXIM backbone [1] pre-trained on the sidd. You can use this
model for image denoising. Please refer to the Colab Notebook linked on this page for more details.

MAXIM introduces a common backbone for different image processing tasks like
denoising, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, and enhancement. You can find the complete
collection of MAXIM models on TF-Hub on [this page](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/collections/maxim/1).

## Notes

* The original model weights are provided in [2]. There were ported to Keras models
(`tf.keras.Model`) and then serialized as TensorFlow SavedModels. The porting
steps are available in [3].
* The format of the model handle is: `'maxim_{variant}_{task}_{dataset}'`.
* The model can be unrolled into a standard Keras model and you can inspect its topology.
To do so, first download the model from TF-Hub and then load it using `tf.keras.models.load_model`
providing the path to the downloaded model folder.
