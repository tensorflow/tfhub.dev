## Overview

This is the implementation of  RegNetY<sup>[1]</sup>  in TensorFlow 2.5.

## Using this model

This model is pretrained on ImageNet-1k. Thus, it can be easily fine-tuned for a plethora of downstream tasks. 

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/adityakane2001/regnety400mf_feature_extractor/1", training=False), # Can be True
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes)
])

model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)
```

Inputs to the model must:
1. be four dimensional Tensors of the shape `(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`. Note that the model expects images with  `channels_last`  property. `height`,`width` and `batch_size` can be any value based on user's preference. `num_channels` must be 3.
2. have pixel values in the range `[0, 255]`.

You can use with `training=False` or `training=True`. For a detailed guide on how to fine-tune these models, see here<sup>[2]</sup>. 

Note that all images are resized to 224x224 inside the model itself. This means the heavylifting of resizing all images is delegated to the hardware accelerator.   
This also implies that even though you may pass large images, they will be resized to 224x224. So passing large images will not result in a difference in performance.

One known caveat of this implementation is as of TensorFlow 2.5, this model can run only on GPU or TPU and not CPU. This is because grouped convolutions used in this model are not supported on CPUs be TensorFlow. At the time of writing this, grouped convs are not functional at all in Keras with TensorFlow 2.6.0. You can track the progress on this [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/15162).
