# Lite sayakpaul/mirnet-fixed/dr/1
TF Lite quantized version of the MIRNet model to enhance a low-light image.

### Overview
The MIRNet model is proposed in [1]. The model can take a low-light image and enhance it to a great extent. Here is an example result -

### Note
- This model was quantized using _dynamic range quantization_ as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).
- This model is populated with metadata.
- This model takes fixed-shaped (400x400) inputs (images with RGB channel ordering).
- The Colab Notebook that accompanies the model contains conversion and inference steps.

### Acknowledgements
Soumik trained the original model that was used for generating the TensorFlow Lite models. Soumik's code repository is available [here](https://github.com/soumik12345/MIRNet). Thanks to Khanh LeViet for helping to verify the metadata population.
