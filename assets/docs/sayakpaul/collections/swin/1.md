# Collection sayakpaul/swin/1

Collection of Swin Transformers.

<!-- dataset: imagenet-ilsvrc-2012-cls -->
<!-- task: image-classification -->

## Overview

This collection contains different Swin Transformer [1, 2] models. For more details on the training protocols,
please follow [3, 4]. The original model weights are provided from [3, 4]. There were ported to Keras models
(`tf.keras.Model`) and then serialized as TensorFlow SavedModels. The porting steps are available in [5].
Some models in this collection were first pre-trained on ImageNet-22k and then fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k.
Rest were directly pre-trained on ImageNet-1k. The former usually leads to better performance.

Note that ImageNet-22k and ImageNet-21k refer to the same dataset.

## About the models

Models included in this collection have two variants: (1) off-the-shelf inference for image
classification, (2) fine-tuning on downstream tasks. These models are accompanied by
Colab Notebooks for demonstration purposes. 

The table below provides a performance summary (ImageNet-1k validation set):

The `base` and `large` models were first pre-trained on the ImageNet-22k dataset and then fine-tuned
on the ImageNet-1k dataset.

[This directory](https://github.com/sayakpaul/swin-transformers-tf/tree/main/in1k-eval) provides details
on how these numbers were generated. Original scores for all the models except for the `s3` ones were
gathered from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer/blob/main/get_started.md). Scores
for the `s3` model were gathered from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Cream/tree/main/AutoFormerV2#model-zoo).

## Notes

All the models output attention weights from each of the transformer blocks. The [classification Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/swin-transformers-tf/blob/main/notebooks/classification.ipynb) shows how to fetch the attention weights for a given prediction image.
