### About KerasOCR

Keras OCR is a end to end library for detection and recognizing text(OCR).

- It is implemented with CRAFT as text detector and CRNN as text recognizer.

- Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network in short CRNN is very popular model for text recognition.

- Keras OCR also provides support for fine tuning on our custom datasets. We can also fine tune detector and recognizer separately with the help of Keras OCR.

- While Converting to TFLite Format CTC Decoder part is removed from the model as it was not supported in TFLite Format. So we need to run explicitly decoder on output of the model for the final output. You can find the post-processing steps in the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tulasiram58827/ocr_tflite/blob/main/colabs/KERAS_OCR_TFLITE.ipynb)

- Model was quantized using `dynamic range` quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- The Colab Notebook contains further information on running this model in real-time settings.

- Original model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/faustomorales/keras-ocr)
