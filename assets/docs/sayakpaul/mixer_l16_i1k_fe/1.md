## Overview

This model is an MLP-Mixer of type L-16 [1] pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset [2] and fine-tuned on the ImageNet-1k dataset [2]. This is suitable for fine-tuning.

## Using this model

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.InputLayer((224, 224, 3)),
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/mixer_l16_i1k_fe/1", trainable=True),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax")
])
...
```

Inputs to the model must:

1. be four dimensional Tensors of the shape `(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`. Note that the model expects
   images with  `channels_last`  property. `num_channels` must be 3. 
2. be resized to 224x224 resolution.
3. have pixel values in the range `[-1, 1]`.


## Notes

The original model weights are provided as a `.npz` file [3]. There were ported to a TensorFlow SavedModel. The porting
steps are available in [4].
