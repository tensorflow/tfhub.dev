# Collection rishit-dagli/convmixer/1
Collection of new ConvMixer models pre-trained on ImageNet-1k.

<!-- task: image-classification -->
<!-- network-architecture: convmixer -->
<!-- dataset: imagenet -->

## Overview

This collection contains three different ConvMixer [3] models that were pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset [4]. The authors of "Patches Are All You Need?" paper open-sourced three different variants of ConvMixer models in PyTorch. ConvMixer is a simple model that uses only standard convolutions to achieve the mixing steps. Despite it's simplicity ConvMixer outperforms ViT and MLP-Mixer [3].

The models contained in this collection were converted from the original model classes and weights [2] using the onnx-tensorflow tool [5] and modifying the way the official code implementation does padding. For more details on the conversion process, please follow [this notebook](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/ConvMixer-torch2tf/blob/main/conversion.ipynb).

A complete tutorial to  use the models in these collections for image classification can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/ConvMixer-torch2tf/blob/main/classification.ipynb).
