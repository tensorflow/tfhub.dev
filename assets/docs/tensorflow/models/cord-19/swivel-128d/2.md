## Overview

These text embeddings were trained with
[Swivel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02215) on the
[COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research).

## Data

The [CORD-19 dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research)
was released by the Allen Institute for AI in partnership with leading research
groups in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset is a free resource of
over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over 13,000 with full text, about
COVID-19 and the coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research
community.

## Model

The embeddings were trained with
[Swivel co-occurrence matrix factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02215)
for 80 epochs using the
[Google Cloud AI Hub text2hub pipeline](https://aihub.cloud.google.com/u/0/p/products%2F4a91d2d0-1fb8-4e79-adf7-a35707071195).
The model maps from text to 128-dimensional vectors and has a vocabulary size of
69632 tokens as well as an OOV bucket.

The model was trained on the titles, authors, abstracts, body texts, and
reference titles of articles in the CORD-19 dataset. Text from the commercial
use, non-commercial use, and bioRxiv/medRxiv subsets was included in the
training corpus. The co-occurrences are calculated using a sliding window of 10
tokens over text in the training corpus. Tokens are determined by splitting on
space and stripping tokens in `string.punctuation`. Tokens are included in the
vocabulary of the model if they occur at least 20 times in the corpus.

## Use

These embeddings are being released as a tool for researchers to use in COVID-19
research related natural language processing tasks. The Kaggle
[COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
has several tasks representing key scientific questions about COVID-19. These
include:

*   What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?
*   What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?
*   Help us understand how geography affects virality.

The embeddings can be used as a piece to build a larger machine learning system
that is able to draw insights about COVID-19 research.

## Limitations

These embeddings were trained on the 2020-03-13 release of the CORD-19 dataset
and may not capture more recent information that arises about COVID-19. The
CORD-19 dataset is a dataset of academic papers and as such may not generalize
for use in other domains such as news articles. This model does not solve any
COVID-19 related tasks in and of itself, but is intended to be used as a tool by
NLP researchers to support their investigations into deriving insights about
COVID-19.

## Explore

These embeddings can be visualized using the TensorFlow Embedding Projector. You
can explore the CORD-19 embeddings to see which tokens in the vocabulary appear
close by in the embedding space

## Example use

These text embeddings can be used in TF 1.x or TF 2.x.

#### TensorFlow 2.x usage

Fine-tuning is supported in TF 2.x by passing `trainable=True` to the
`hub.KerasLayer(...)` call.

```python
# %tensorflow_version 2.x

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

embed = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/cord-19/swivel-128d/2")
embeddings = embed(tf.constant(["coronavirus", "WHO", "wash your hands"]))
print(embeddings)

# Use the embeddings as text representations to solve downstream tasks
# For example analyzing COVID-19 risk factors from the literature
```

#### TensorFlow 1.x usage

```python
# %tensorflow_version 1.x

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

embed = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/cord-19/swivel-128d/2")
embeddings = embed(["coronavirus", "WHO", "wash your hands"])

with tf.train.MonitoredSession() as sess:
  embeddings_out = sess.run(embeddings)
  print(embeddings_out)

# Use the embeddings as text representations to solve downstream tasks
# For example analyzing COVID-19 risk factors from the literature
```

## Changelog

#### Version 1
*  Initial release.

#### Version 2
