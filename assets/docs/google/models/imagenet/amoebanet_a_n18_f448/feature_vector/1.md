## hub.Module for TF1

This is a hub.Module for use with TensorFlow 1.

## Overview

AmoebaNet is a family of convolutional neural networks for image classification.
The architectures of its convolutional cells (or layers) have been found by an
evolutionary architecture search in the NASNet search space.
AmoebaNet and the NASNet search space were published, respectively, by

  * Esteban Real, Alok Aggarwal, Yanping Huang and Quoc V. Le:
    "Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search",
    preprint at [arXiv:1802.01548](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548).
  * Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Jonathon Shlens, Quoc V. Le:
    ["Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image
    Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012), CVPR 2018.

This TF-Hub module uses the open-source implementation of
[AmoebaNet-A](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/amoeba_net)
for ImageNet that uses <i>N</i> = 18 Normal Cells,
starting with <i>F</i> = 448 convolutional filters.
It has an input size of 331x331 pixels.

The model contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use
[`google/imagenet/amoebanet_a_n18_f448/classification/1`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/amoebanet_a_n18_f448/classification/1)
instead.


## Training

The weights for this module were obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("ImageNet") with Inception-style preprocessing
and data augmentation, as described in the AmoebaNet paper.


## Usage

This module implements the common signature for computing
[image feature vectors](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
It can be used with the `hub.Module` API like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/amoebanet_a_n18_f448/feature_vector/1")
height, width = hub.get_expected_image_size(module)
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

...or using the signature name `image_feature_vector`.
For use with TF2 APIs, see TF Hub's [migration
guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/migration_tf2.md).

The output for each image
in the batch is a feature vector of size `num_features` = 7168.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.
For this model, the size of the input images is fixed to
`height` x `width` = 331 x 331 pixels.


## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this module can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#fine-tuning) it.

Fine-tuning requires to import the graph version with tag set `{"train"}`
in order to operate batch normalization and dropout in training mode.
The dropout probability in AmoebaNet's path dropout is not scaled with
the training steps of fine-tuning and remains at the final (maximal) value
from the initial training.
