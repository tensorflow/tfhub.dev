# Module deepmind/ganeval-cifar10-convnet/1
Deep VGG style network trained on CIFAR-10.

<!-- dataset: CIFAR-10 -->
<!-- asset-path: legacy -->
<!-- module-type: image-classification -->
<!-- network-architecture: VGG-style -->
<!-- fine-tunable: false -->
<!-- format: hub -->


## Example use
```python
model = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/ganeval-cifar10-convnet/1")
logits = model(images)
```

## Module structure

The model has 11 convolutional layers with increasing number of channels, 
followed by an average pooling layer on which a linear layer is applied to 
obtain to 10 softmax logits. The model uses BatchNorm. 


## Training

The model was trained on random patches 24x24 cropped data patches. 
After cropping, data augumentation was used via 
`tf.image.random_flip_left_right`.

The MomentumOptimizer was used for training, with a momentum of 0.9. A decaying
learning schedule was used, starting with 0.1 and decaying by a multiplicative
factor of 0.1 every 10^3 epochs. The training batch size is 32.
