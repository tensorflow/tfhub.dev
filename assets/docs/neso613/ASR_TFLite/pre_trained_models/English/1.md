## About Conformer

Transformer and CNN based models have shown promising results in Automatic Speech Recognition,significantly outperforms the previous models achieving state-of-the-art accuracies. 

- This model is trained on LibriSpeech dataset.

- Pre-trained Model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowASR)

- Model is quantized using `dynamic range` quantization method as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- You can use [this](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowASR#tflite-convertion) to convert the pre-trained models to TFLite Format.

- You can use [Inference Notebook](https://github.com/neso613/ASR_TFLite/blob/main/scripts/subword-conformer.latest_for_english_inference.ipynb) with TFLite ASR model to generate text from speech.

- You can visit [TensorFlow ASR Repository](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowASR) for other ASR models.

- You can visit [ASR TFLite Repository](https://github.com/neso613/ASR_TFLite) for other TFLite models.
