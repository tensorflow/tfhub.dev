## Overview

CenterNet meta-architecture from the
["Objects as Points"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07850) paper with the
ResNet-V2-50 backbone trained on the [COCO 2017](https://cocodataset.org/)
dataset. Model created using the
[TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).
The ResNet backbone has a few differences as compared to the one mentioned in
the paper, hence the performance is slightly worse.

An example detection result is shown below.

#### Example use

```
# Apply image detector on a single image.
detector = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/centernet/resnet50v2_512x512/1")
detector_output = detector(image_tensor)
class_ids = detector_output["detection_classes"]
```

### Inputs

A three-channel image of variable size - the model does **NOT** support
batching. The input tensor is a `tf.uint8` tensor with shape `[1, height, width,
3]` with values in `[0.0, 255]`.

### Outputs

The output dictionary contains:

*   `num_detections`: a `tf.int` tensor with only one value, the number of
    detections [N].
*   `detection_boxes`: a `tf.float32` tensor of shape `[N, 4]` containing
    bounding box coordinates in the following order: `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]`.
*   `detection_classes`: a `tf.int` tensor of shape `[N]` containing detection
    class index from the label file.
*   `detection_scores`: a `tf.float32` tensor of shape `[N]` containing
    detection scores.

### Suitable use cases

This model is **suitable** for localizing the most prominent objects in an
image.

### Unsuitable use cases

This model is **unsuitable** for standalone use in mission-critical applications
such as obstacle and human detection for autonomous driving.

#### Source

The model's checkpoints are
[publicly available](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)
as a part of
[TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).
