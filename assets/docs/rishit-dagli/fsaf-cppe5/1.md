### TF2 SavedModel
This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2 format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model). Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

### Overview
The FSAF model was proposed by Zhu et al. in their paper "Feature Selective Anchor-Free Module for Single-Shot Object Detection" [2]. The FSAF model is trained on the CPPE - 5 dataset we present in our paper "CPPE - 5: Medical Personal Protective Equipment Dataset" [1] which is a new challenging dataset with an aim to facilitate the study of subordinate categorization of medical personal protective equipments. This dataset mostly contains non-iconic images or non-canonical perspectives in their natural context. This allows models to be better at generalizing, being easily deployable to real-world scenarios and often contain other objects in an image as well.

We include the training code as well some tools for this model in our paper GitHub repository [3].

Note: In no case should this model be used to engage in any kind of high-risk activities, please [TF Hub Additional Terms of Service](https://tfhub.dev/terms#hra) for more information.

### Model Performance
Here we present the performance of the FSAF model on the CPPE - 5 dataset. For evaluation, we adopt the metrics from the COCO detection evaluation criteria, including the mean Average Precision (AP) across IoU thresholds ranging from 0.50 to 0.95 at different scales.

|   Method    | AP<sup>box</sup> | AP<sub>50</sub><sup>box</sup> | AP<sub>75</sub><sup>box</sup> | AP<sub>S</sub><sup>box</sup> | AP<sub>M</sub><sup>box</sup> | AP<sub>L</sub><sup>box</sup> |
| :---------: | :--------------: | :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| FSAF | 49.2 | 84.7 | 48.2 | 45.3 | 39.6 | 56.7 |

### Usage
The saved model can be loaded directly:

```py
import tensorflow_hub as hub

model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/fsaf-cppe5/1")
```

The inputs to the models should:

- have color values in the range `[0,1]`, following the [common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input) conventions
- the expected size of the input images is height x width = 800 x 1216 pixels
- the images should in the `channels_first` format
- The shape of the input tensor would ths be `(1, 3, 800, 1216)`, the first dimension represents the batch size

The model outputs are:

- `outputs['dets']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100, 5]` with the bounding boxes in normalized coordinates.
- `outputs['labels']`: A tensor of shape `[batch_size, 100]` with the class labels for the bounding boxes.

It can also be used within a KerasLayer:

```py
hub_layer = hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/rishit-dagli/fsaf-cppe5/1")
```

### Model Complexity
We measure the model complexity in terms of the number of parameters FLOPS and FPS. The inference speed FPS (Frames per second) for detector is measured on a machine with 1 Tesla V100 GPU.

|          Method           |      AP<sup>box</sup>      | #Params  |   FLOPs   | FPS  |
|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:----:|
|        FSAF               |            49.2            |  93.75 M |  435.88 G | 5.6  |
