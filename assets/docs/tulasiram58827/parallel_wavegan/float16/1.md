## About Parallel-WaveGAN

It is a distillation-free, fast, and smallfootprint waveform generation method using a generative adversarial network.

- This model is trained on LJSpeech dataset.

- Pre-trained Model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN)

- Model is quantized using `float16` quantization method as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- You can use this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tulasiram58827/TTS_TFLite/blob/main/Parallel_WaveGAN_TFLite.ipynb) to convert the pre-trained models to TFLite Format.

- You can use [End to End Inference Notebook](https://github.com/tulasiram58827/TTS_TFLite/blob/main/End_to_End_TTS.ipynb) with Tacotron2, FastSpeech to generate speech from text.
