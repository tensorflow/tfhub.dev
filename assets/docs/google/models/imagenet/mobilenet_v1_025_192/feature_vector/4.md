## TF2 SavedModel

This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2
format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model).
Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

## Overview

MobileNet V1 is a family of neural network architectures for efficient
on-device image classification, originally published by

  * Andrew G. Howard, Menglong Zhu, Bo Chen, Dmitry Kalenichenko, Weijun Wang,
    Tobias Weyand, Marco Andreetto, Hartwig Adam:
    ["MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for
    Mobile Vision Applications"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861), 2017.

Mobilenets come in various sizes controlled by a multiplier for the
depth (number of features) in the convolutional layers. They can also be
trained for various sizes of input images to control inference speed.
This TF Hub model uses the TF-Slim implementation of
`mobilenet_v1_025`
with a depth multiplier of 0.25 and an input size of
192x192 pixels.

The model contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use
[`google/imagenet/mobilenet_v1_025_192/classification/4`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v1_025_192/classification/4)
instead.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this model was `mobilenet_v1_2018_02_22/mobilenet_v1_0.25_192/mobilenet_v1_0.25_192.ckpt` downloaded
from
[MobileNet pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").

## Usage

This model can be used with the `hub.KerasLayer` as follows.
It *cannot* be used with the `hub.Module` API for TensorFlow 1.

```python
m = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v1_025_192/feature_vector/4",
                   trainable=False),  # Can be True, see below.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
m.build([None, 192, 192, 3])  # Batch input shape.
```

The output is a batch of feature vectors. For each input image,
the feature vector has size `num_features` = 256. The feature
vectors can then be used further, e.g., for classification as above.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.
The expected size of the input images is
`height` x `width` = 192 x 192 pixels
by default, but other input sizes are possible (within limits).


## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this model can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) it
by passing `trainable=True` to `hub.KerasLayer`.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this model, in order to accelerate training
on small datasets (or with huge batch sizes).
Advanced users can set another value (say, 0.997) by loading this model like

```python
hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v1_025_192/feature_vector/4",
               trainable=True, arguments=dict(batch_norm_momentum=0.997))
```


## Changelog

#### Version 1

  * Initial release.

#### Version 3

  * Support for variable input size.
  * Fine-tuning: change default batch norm momentum to 0.99 and
    make it configurable.
  * Requires PIP package `tensorflow-hub>=0.2.0`.

#### Version 4

  * Switched to the SavedModel format of TensorFlow 2.
    The `hub.Module` class cannot load this or later versions any more.
