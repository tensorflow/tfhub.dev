## About HiFi-GAN

It is a GAN based Model capable of generating high fidelity speech efficiently. A small footprint of HiFi-GAN generates samples 13.4 times faster than real-time on CPU with comparable quality to an autoregressive counterpart.

- This model is trained on LJSpeech dataset.

- Pre-trained Model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/jik876/hifi-gan)

- Model is quantized using `dynamic range` quantization method as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- You can use this [notebook](https://github.com/tulasiram58827/TTS_TFLite/blob/main/HiFi-GAN.ipynb) to convert the pre-trained models to TFLite Format.

- You can use [End to End Inference Notebook](https://github.com/tulasiram58827/TTS_TFLite/blob/main/End_to_End_TTS.ipynb) with Tacotron2, FastSpeech to generate speech from text.
