Image classification model based on Inception v4.

<!-- module-type: image-classification -->

## Overview

Inception V4 is a neural network architecture for image classification,
originally published in [1].

This model is quantized. Quantized image classification models offer the
smallest model size and fastest performance, at the expense of accuracy.
