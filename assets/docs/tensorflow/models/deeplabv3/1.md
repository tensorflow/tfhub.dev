Deep learning model for semantic image segmentation.

<!-- module-type: image-segmentation -->
<!-- task: image-segmentation -->

## Overview

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation,
where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g. person, dog, cat) to every
pixel in the input image. It was published in [1].
