## Overview

This model is trained to recognize more than 100,000 popular supermarket
products in the United States from images. The model is mobile-friendly and can
run on-device.

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 224 x 224,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `prediction:logits`.

*   `prediction:logits`: A vector of 100000 similarity scores, corresponding to
    items in the
    [labelmap](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/labelmaps/popular_us_products_V1_labelmap.csv).
    Note that each item may appear multiple times; there are 99375 unique
    labels.

## Example use

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.Module('https://tfhub.dev/google/on_device_vision/classifier/popular_us_products_V1/1')
...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/on_device_vision/classifier/popular_us_products_V1/1')
...
```
