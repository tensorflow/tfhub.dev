## Overview

This model is a CaiT [1] model pre-trained on the ImageNet-1k dataset. You can find the complete
collection of CaiT models on TF-Hub on [this page](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/collections/cait/1).

You can use this model for performing off-the-shelf classification. Please refer to
the Colab Notebook linked on this page for more details.

## Notes

* The original model weights are provided from [2]. There were ported to Keras models
(`tf.keras.Model`) and then serialized as TensorFlow SavedModels. The porting
steps are available in [3].
* The model can be unrolled into a standard Keras model and you can inspect its topology.
To do so, first download the model from TF-Hub and then load it using `tf.keras.models.load_model`
providing the path to the downloaded model folder.
