This repository provides an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for TensorFlow 2.x. These models primarily come from two repositories - [asr](https://www.huylenguyen.com/asr) and [TensorFlowASR](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowASR). We provide end-to-end Jupyter Notebooks that show the inference process using TFLite.
