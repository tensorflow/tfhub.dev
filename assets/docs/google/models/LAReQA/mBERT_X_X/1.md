# Module google/LAReQA/mBERT_X_X/1

Language-agnostic question answering model for retrieving answers from a
multilingual candidate pool.

<!-- asset-path: internal -->
<!-- dataset: SQuAD -->
<!-- fine-tunable: true -->
<!-- format: hub -->
<!-- language: multilingual -->
<!-- module-type: text-retrieval-question-answering -->
<!-- network-architecture: ReQA -->

## Overview

This is the X-X baseline model from the
[LAReQA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05484). For a similar model with
stronger cross-lingual alignment, see the module: 'google/LAReQA/mBERT_X_Y'.

This model adapts
[multilingual BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md)
for QA retrieval by fine-tuning on a translated version of
[SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/), translating each question-
answer pair into the 11 [XQuAD](https://github.com/deepmind/xquad) languages
using a translation system. The question and answer within a single example are
always translated to the same language. However, examples in same training batch
may cover different languages.

Questions and candidate answers are encoded separately. A question-answer pair
can be scored by taking the dot-product of the question and answer embeddings.
Candidate answers consist of both the answering sentence, as well the
surrounding paragraph of context.

The model supports 11 languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Greek, Hindi,
Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Russian, and Vietnamese.

## Example use

```python
!pip install tensorflow-text
import tensorflow_text as text  # Import TF.text ops
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import numpy as np

loaded = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/google/LAReQA/mBERT_X_X/1")

question_encoder = loaded.signatures["query_encoder"]
response_encoder = loaded.signatures["response_encoder"]

questions = [
    "When was Chopin born?",
    "What is the earth's circumference?",
    # Same questions in Chinese:
    "肖邦是什么时候出生的？",
    "地球的周长是多少？"]

responses = [
    "He was born in 1810.",
    "Its circumference is 40,075 kilometers.",
    # Same sentences in Chinese:
    "他出生于1810年。",
    "其周长为40075公里。"]

response_contexts = [
    "Chopin was a Polish-French composer. He was born in 1810.",
    "The Earth's shape is nearly spherical. Its circumference is 40,075 "
    "kilometers.",
    # Same contexts in Chinese:
    "肖邦是波兰法国作曲家。 他出生于1810年。",
    "地球的形状几乎是球形的。 其周长为40075公里。"]

question_embeddings = question_encoder(
    input=tf.constant(np.asarray(questions)))["outputs"]

response_embeddings = response_encoder(
    input=tf.constant(np.asarray(responses)),
    context=tf.constant(np.asarray(response_contexts)))["outputs"]

scores = np.matmul(question_embeddings.numpy(),
                   np.transpose(response_embeddings.numpy()))
```
