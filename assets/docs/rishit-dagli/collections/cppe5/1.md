# Collection rishit-dagli/cppe5/1
Collection of the models trained on the new CPPE-5 dataset [1].

<!-- task: image-object-detection -->
<!-- network-architecture: multiple -->
<!-- dataset: cppe-5 -->

## Overview

This collection contains seven different models that were pre-trained on the CPPE-5 dataset we present in our paper "CPPE - 5: Medical Personal Protective Equipment Dataset" [1] which is a new challenging dataset with an aim to facilitate the study of subordinate categorization of medical personal protective equipments. This dataset mostly contains non-iconic images or non-canonical perspectives in their natural context. This allows models to be better at generalizing, being easily deployable to real-world scenarios and often contain other objects in an image as well.

The training code for these can be found in our paper GitHub repository [2].

Note: In no case should these models be used to engage in any kind of high-risk activities, please [TF Hub Additional Terms of Service](https://tfhub.dev/terms#hra) for more information.
