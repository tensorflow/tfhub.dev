## Overview

This module was pretrained for remote sensing applications on the So2Sat
dataset.

## Usage

This module implements the common signature for
[image feature-vector](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
It can be used like

```python
module = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/remote_sensing/so2sat-ms-resnet50/1")
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

For this module, the size of the input image is flexible, but it would be best
to match the model training input, which was `height` x `width` = 224 x 224
pixels. The input multi-spectral `images` are expected to have color values in
the range [0,1], following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.

## Fine-tuning

The recommended use of this module is to
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf1_hub_module#fine-tuning) it on custom datasets.

Fine-tuning requires importing the graph version with tag set `{"train"}` in
order to operate batch normalization in training mode.
