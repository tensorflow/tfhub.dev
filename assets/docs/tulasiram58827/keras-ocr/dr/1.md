### About KerasOCR

Keras OCR Model is actually a slightly modified CRNN implementation. Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network in short CRNN is very popular model for text recognition.


- Model was quantized using `dynamic range` quantization as described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quant).

- The Colab Notebook contains further information on running this model in real-time settings.

- Original model weights are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/faustomorales/keras-ocr)
