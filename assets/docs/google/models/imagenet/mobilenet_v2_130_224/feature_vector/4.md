## TF2 SavedModel

This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2
format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model).
Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

## Overview

MobileNet V2 is a family of neural network architectures for efficient
on-device image classification and related tasks, originally published by

  * Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard, Menglong Zhu, Andrey Zhmoginov,
    Liang-Chieh Chen: ["Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks:
    Mobile Networks for Classification, Detection and
    Segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381), 2018.

Mobilenets come in various sizes controlled by a multiplier for the
depth (number of features) in the convolutional layers. They can also be
trained for various sizes of input images to control inference speed.

This TF Hub model uses the TF-Slim implementation of
`mobilenet_v2`
with a depth multiplier of 1.3 and an input size of
224x224 pixels.
This implementation of Mobilenet V2 rounds feature depths to multiples of 8
(an optimization *not* described in the paper).
Depth multipliers less than 1.0 are not applied to the last convolutional layer
(from which the module takes the image feature vector).

The model contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use
[`google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4)
instead.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this model was `mobilenet_v2_1.3_224/mobilenet_v2_1.3_224.ckpt` downloaded
from
[MobileNet V2 pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet/README.md).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").

## Usage

This model can be used with the `hub.KerasLayer` as follows.
It *cannot* be used with the `hub.Module` API for TensorFlow 1.

```python
m = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/feature_vector/4",
                   trainable=False),  # Can be True, see below.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
m.build([None, 224, 224, 3])  # Batch input shape.
```

The output is a batch of feature vectors. For each input image,
the feature vector has size `num_features` = 1664. The feature
vectors can then be used further, e.g., for classification as above.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.
For this model, the size of the input images is fixed to
`height` x `width` = 224 x 224 pixels.


## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this model can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) it
by passing `trainable=True` to `hub.KerasLayer`.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this model, in order to accelerate training
on small datasets (or with huge batch sizes).
Advanced users can set another value (say, 0.997) by loading this model like

```python
hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/feature_vector/4",
               trainable=True, arguments=dict(batch_norm_momentum=0.997))
```


## Changelog

#### Version 1

  * Initial release.

#### Version 2

  * Fixed broken UPDATE_OPS for fine-tuning,
    [GitHub issue 86](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/issues/86).

#### Version 3

  * Fine-tuning: change default batch norm momentum to 0.99 and
    make it configurable.
  * Requires PIP package `tensorflow-hub>=0.2.0`.

#### Version 4

  * Switched to the SavedModel format of TensorFlow 2.
    The `hub.Module` class cannot load this or later versions any more.
