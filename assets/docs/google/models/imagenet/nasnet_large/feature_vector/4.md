## TF2 SavedModel

This is a [SavedModel in TensorFlow 2
format](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model).
Using it requires TensorFlow 2 (or 1.15) and TensorFlow Hub 0.5.0 or newer.

## Overview

NASNet-A is a family of convolutional neural networks for image classification.
The architecture of its convolutional cells (or layers) has been found by
Neural Architecture Search (NAS). NAS and NASNet were originally published by

  * Barret Zoph, Quoc V. Le: ["Neural Architecture Search
    with Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578), 2017.
  * Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Jonathon Shlens, Quoc V. Le:
    ["Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image
    Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012), 2017.

NASNets come in various sizes. This TF Hub model uses the TF-Slim
implementation `nasnet_large` of NASNet-A for ImageNet
that uses 18 Normal Cells, starting with
168 convolutional filters (after the "ImageNet stem").
It has an input size of 331x331 pixels.

The model contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use
[`google/imagenet/nasnet_large/classification/4`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/nasnet_large/classification/4)
instead.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this model was `nasnet-a_large_04_10_2017/model.ckpt` downloaded
from
[NASNet's pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/nasnet/README.md).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("ImageNet").

## Usage

This model can be used with the `hub.KerasLayer` as follows.
It *cannot* be used with the `hub.Module` API for TensorFlow 1.

```python
m = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/nasnet_large/feature_vector/4",
                   trainable=False),  # Can be True, see below.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
m.build([None, 331, 331, 3])  # Batch input shape.
```

The output is a batch of feature vectors. For each input image,
the feature vector has size `num_features` = 4032. The feature
vectors can then be used further, e.g., for classification as above.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the
[common image input](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/images#input)
conventions.
For this model, the size of the input images is fixed to
`height` x `width` = 331 x 331 pixels.


## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this model can
[fine-tune](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) it.
by passing `trainable=True` to `hub.KerasLayer`.

The dropout probability in NASNet path dropout is not scaled with
the training steps of fine-tuning and remains at the final (maximal) value
from the initial training.

The momentum (a.k.a. decay coefficient) of batch norm's exponential moving
averages defaults to 0.99 for this model, in order to accelerate training
on small datasets (or with huge batch sizes).
Advanced users can set another value (say, 0.997) by loading this model like

```python
hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/nasnet_large/feature_vector/4",
               trainable=True, arguments=dict(batch_norm_momentum=0.997))
```


## Changelog

#### Version 1

  * Initial release.

#### Version 3

  * Fine-tuning: change default batch norm momentum to 0.99 and
    make it configurable.
  * Requires PIP package `tensorflow-hub>=0.2.0`.

#### Version 4

  * Switched to the SavedModel format of TensorFlow 2.
    The `hub.Module` class cannot load this or later versions any more.
