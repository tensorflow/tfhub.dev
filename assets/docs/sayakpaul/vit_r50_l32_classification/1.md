## Overview

This model is a hybrid Vision Transformer of type R50-L32 [1, 2] fine-tuned on the ImageNet-1k dataset [3]. 

## Using this model

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/vit_r50_l32_classification/1")
])
predictions = model.predict(images) 
```

Inputs to the model must:

1. be four dimensional Tensors of the shape `(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`. Note that the model expects images with  `channels_last`  property. `num_channels` must be 3. 
2. be resized to 224x224 resolution.
3. have pixel values in the range `[-1, 1]`.

The model also has a [feature extractor variant](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/vit_r50_l32_fe/1) which should be used for the purposes of transfer learning. For more details, please refer to the accompanying Colab Notebook. _**Please make sure the inputs are in [-1, 1] range as opposed to [0, 1].**_

## Notes

The original model weights are provided as a `.npz` file [4]. There were ported to a TensorFlow SavedModel. The porting steps are available in [5].
