# Module google/mosaic/mobilenetmultiavgseg/1

MOSAIC is a neural network architecture for efficient and accurate semantic
image segmentation on mobile devices.

## Overview

MOSAIC is designed using commonly supported neural operations by diverse mobile
hardware platforms for flexible deployment across various mobile platforms.
MOSAIC achieves a 5% absolute accuracy gain on ADE20K with similar or lower
latency compared to the current industry standard MLPerf mobile v1.0 models and
state-of-the-art architectures. 

MLPerf Mobile v2.0 included MOSAIC as a new industry standard benchmark model
for image segmentation. Please see details [here](https://mlcommons.org/en/news/mlperf-inference-1q2022/).

This TF Hub model uses the implementation from the [TensorFlow Model Garden GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/mosaic), and achieves 77.24% mIoU on Cityscapes dataset with 19 classes.

### Example use

The example usage is

```python 
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Download the model from Tensorflow Hub.
keras_layer = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/mosaic/mobilenetmultiavgseg/1')
model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras_layer])
model.build([None, IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, 3])

images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, 3].

# Run segmentation.
output_data = model(images)
```

### Training

Please check out the [TF Model Garden MOSAIC implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/mosaic) for model training.
